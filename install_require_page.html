<p >PSCF is designed to be compiled and run in a unix-like environment. The package has been tested and used on systems running either linux or recent versions of the Mac OS X operating systems. Compilation is controlled by a system of unix makefiles.</p>
<p >PSCF is distributed only as source code, and must be compiled by the user. All source code that is designed to run on a conventional CPU is written in ANSI 2011 C++ language standard. Code that is written for an NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) is written in UDA.</p>
<p >In order to compile in Mac OS X, the computer must be configured to resemble a unix command-line development environment by installing the Command Line Tools package for XCode. In recent versions of Mac OS X, it is not necessary to install the much larger XCode integrated development environment (IDE) to obtain just the command line tools, though some users may prefer to install XCode. If you do choose to install the XCode package, installation of the Command Line Tools is offered as an option during the installation process. Instructions for installing just the command line tools are available <a href="https://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/">online</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="require_overview_section"></a>
Overview</h1>
<p >The PSCF package provides several programs that are designed to run on a conventional CPU, and others that are designed to also use an NVIDIA GPU. We distinguish these in what follows by referring to CPU programs and GPU-enabled programs</p>
<p >In order to compile all of the CPU programs in the PSCF package, the system on which the code is compiled and run must have:</p><ul>
<li>a git version control client</li>
<li>a C++ compiler</li>
<li>a python interpreter</li>
<li>the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) (header and library)</li>
<li>the FFTW fast Fourier transform library (header and library)</li>
</ul>
<p >A git client is needed to obtain the source code, by cloning the git repository in which it is maintained on the github.com site. A python interpreter is needed during compilation because the build system that compiles PSCF uses several python scripts. The required scripts are provided as part of the package. A git client, C++ compiler and python interpreter will will normally come pre-installed in either a linux distribution or in a Mac OS operating system in which command line tools have been installed. The GNU scientific library is used by several programs within the package for linear algebra operations. The FFTW Fast Fourier transform library is used by the CPU version of the pseudo-spectral algorithm for periodic microstructures.</p>
<p >In order compile GPU-enabled programs, the system must also have:</p>
<ul>
<li>an NVidia graphics card</li>
<li>the NVidia NVCC CUDA compiler</li>
<li>the CUFFT GPU-accelerated fast Fourier transform library.</li>
</ul>
<p >The CUFFT library is provided with the CUDA development environment.</p>
<p >Users who wish to generate a local copy of this html documentation, as web pages that reside on their own computer, will also need to install the "doxygen" documentation utility.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="require_git_section"></a>
Git client</h1>
<p >The source code for the C++/CUDA version of PSCF described here is hosted on the github server, at <a href="http://github.com">github</a>, as project dmorse/pscfpp. The older fortran PSCF program is maintained in a separate github repository, as project dmorse/pscf. The source code of the new version may be obtained by using a git version control manager to clone the public <a href="https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp">git repository</a>. To do this, a git client must be installed on your computer.</p>
<p >Before attempting to use git to clone the source code, you can check whether a git client is already installed by entering </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; which git</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the unix command line. If git is installed, this should return a valid path, such as "/usr/bin/git". If this command does not return a valid path, you will need to install or enable a git client before proceeding.</p>
<p >Instructions for installing git on different platforms are given in the documentation on the <a href="http://git-scm.com">git web page</a>, and in chapter 1.5 of the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git book </a> by Scott Chacon which is available to be read for free online. <br  />
</p>
<p >If you are using linux, and git is not already installed, you should use the preferred package manager on your linux distribution to install a git client. <br  />
</p>
<p >If you are using Mac OS X, a git client should be installed as a component of the XCode Command Line Tools package, which is needed for many other purposes. <br  />
</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_require_python"></a>
Python</h1>
<p >Similarly, one can check if a python interpreter is accessible by checking if the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">\&gt; which python</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> returns a non-empty path. A python interpreter should be available from the command line in any common linux distribution (e.g., Fedora or Ubuntu) or in Mac OS X after installation of the command line tools package.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_require_compiler_serial"></a>
C++ compiler</h1>
<p >By default, the PSCF build system invokes a C++ compiler using the compiler commnd name "g++". On linux systems, this command normally invokes the gnu compiler collection (gcc) C++ compiler. On a MacIntosh running Mac OS X that is set up for C++ developent (see above), the "g++" command is normally a link to the clang compiler, which is the default compiler for C++ development on Mac OS X. The clang compiler accepts almost all the same command line options as the gnu compiler, and thus functions as a drop-in replacement for the gnu compiler. <br  />
</p>
<p >It is possible to instead configure the build system during the initial setup process so as to use a different C++ compiler. When the gcc or clang compiler is not used for compilation, however, the PSCF build system will still invoke the "g++" command to use the g++ compiler to analyse dependencies among source files. The PSCF makefile system thus always requires that the "g++" command be available on the build system.</p>
<p >One can check if the command "g++" exists by entering </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">\&gt; which g++ </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from a terminal command line. If the "which" utility returns a nonempty path, such as /usr/bin/g++, then the command "g++" exists.</p>
<p >The name of the command used to invoke the compiler when compiling C++ files and the options passed to the compiler can be changed by modifying a compiler setup file that is read during initial setup of the build system. The setup process is described in more detail <a class="el" href="install_setup_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_require_compiler_cuda"></a>
CUDA compiler</h1>
<p >To compile the GPU-accelerated program, the system must also have an appropriate NVIDIA GPU and a CUDA development package installed. The NVIDIA NVCC C++/CUDA compiler is designed to integrate with the GNU g++ compiler, so we recommend using the GNU compiler to compile C++ source files if you are planning to compile CUDA code for use on the same machine.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_require_ubuntu"></a>
Packages: Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux Systems</h1>
<p >The CPU-based programs in PSCF require access to development versions of the Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) and FFTW packages. These may be installed on on Ubuntu or other Debian based linux distribution later on version 16.0 or later using the commands: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">sudo apt install libfftw3-dev   </div>
<div class="line">sudo apt install libgsl-dev   </div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> To also install doxygen documentation generator utility, use the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">sudo apt install doxygen</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> On older Debian-based systems, or as a lower level alternative, one may use the "apt-get" command rather than "apt" with the same arguments.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_require_mac"></a>
Packages: Mac OS X</h1>
<p >We recommend using a package manager to install GSL and FFTW on Mac OS X. If you are not already using a package manager for managing unix programs on Max OS X, we recommend that you install the <a href="https://brew.sh/">Homebrew </a> package manager, following instructions given on the Homebrew web site. Possible alternatives include the older MacPorts or Fink package managers, or compiling the required directly from source files obtained from package home pages.</p>
<p >After the Homebrew system is installed, you may install the GSL and FFTW packages with the commands </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; brew install gsl</div>
<div class="line">&gt; brew install fftw</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> To also install doxygen, issue the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; brew install doxygen</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p >Mac users should be aware that homebrew installs files in different locations on newer Macs that use Apple silicon than the locations used on macs that use Intel cpus:</p>
<p >On Macs with Intel cpus, homebrew installed links to required header and library files in subdirectories of the /usr/local directory. Because /usr/local is one of the standard directories in which a unix shell normally looks for such files, pscfpp can be installed on such machines using a default configuration for the makefile system that is the same as the default used on linux machines.</p>
<p >On Macs with Apple silicon, homebrew instead installs all files in /opt/homebrew. This requires users to add paths to this directory and/or some of its subdirectories to the search paths used by the compiler to find header and library files. A compiler configuration file that modifies these search paths is provided as part of pscf, as discussed <a class="el" href="install_setup_page.html#install_setup_homebrewm1_sec">here</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_require_module"></a>
Linux Software Modules</h1>
<p >At the University of Minnesota, PSCF is often run on a cluster provided by the Minnesota Supercomputer Institute (MSI). The computer clusters at MSI, like many similar multi-user clusters, use the linux "module" command to allow users to load particular software packages, including particular choices of compiler. The "module" command is the user interface to the "Modules" package, which is a system for automating changes in a users unix shell environment that are required in order to use particular software packages.</p>
<p >On a system that uses modules, the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; module avail</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> should give a listing of all software modules available for use on a particular system. The syntax for the command to load a particular module is </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; module load  module-name</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> where module-name represents the name of a particular software module, as listed by the "module avail" command.</p>
<p >On the mesabi cluster at MSI, we currently normally set up the compilation environment by invoking </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; module load fftw/3.3.6-<span class="keywordtype">double</span>-gnu-7.2.0</div>
<div class="line">&gt; module load cuda</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> before compiling PSCF. We use a version of fftw that was compiled with gcc version 7.2.0, rather than the most recent version, because the current version of CUDA (v10.0) isn't compatible with gcc versions with primary version numbers greater than 7.</p>
<p >These module load commands can be either be entered manually from the command line by the user after logging in, or they can be configured to be entered automatically on login by adding them to the users .profile or .bash_profile script.</p>
