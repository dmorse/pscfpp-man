</p>
<p>PSCF is designed to be compiled and run in a unix-like environment. The package has been compiled and used on systems running either linux or a recent version of Mac OS X operating systems. Compilation is controlled by a system of unix makefiles. In order to compile on a MacIntosh computer running Mac OS X, the computer must first be configured for development by installing both the XCode integrated development environment and the command line tools for XCode.</p>
<p>PSCF is distributed only as source code, and must be compiled by the user. All source code that is designed to run on a conventional CPU is written in ANSI 2011 C++ language standard. Code that is written for an NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU) is written in a CUDA.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="require_overview_section"></a>
Overview</h1>
<p>The PSCF package provides several programs that are designed to run on conventional CPUs on a desktop, laptop or cluster, and others that are designed to also use an NVIDIA GPU. We distinguish these in what follows by referring to CPU programs and GPU-enabled programs</p>
<p>In order to compile all of the CPU programs in the PSCF package, the system on which the code is compiled must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a ``git" version control client</li>
<li>a C++ compiler</li>
<li>a python interpreter</li>
<li>the GNU Scientific Library (GSL)</li>
<li>the FFTW fast Fourier transform library.</li>
</ul>
<p>A git client is needed to obtain (clone) the source code, which is maintained in a git repository on the github.com server. A python interpreter is needed during compilation (but not during execution) because the build system that compiles the PSCF source codes uses a few python scripts that are provided with the package. The GNU scientific library is used by several programs within the package for linear algebra operations. The FFTW Fast Fourier transform library is used by the CPU version of the pseudo-spectral algorithm for periodic microstructures.</p>
<p>In order compile GPU-enabled programs, the system must also have:</p>
<ul>
<li>An NVidia graphics card</li>
<li>A CUDA compiler</li>
<li>the CUFFT GPU-accelerated fast Fourier transform library.</li>
</ul>
<p>The CUFFT library is provided with recent versions of the CUDA development environment.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="require_git_section"></a>
Git client</h1>
<p>The source code for the C++/CUDA version of PSCF is hosted on the github server, at <a href="http://github.com">github</a>, as project dmorse/pscfpp. The older fortran PSCF program is maintained in a separate github repository, as project dmorse/pscf. The source code of the new version may be obtained by using a git version control manager to clone the public <a href="https://github.com/dmorse/pscfpp">git repository</a>. To do this, a git client must be installed on your computer.</p>
<p>Before attempting to use git to clone the source code, you can check whether a git client is installed on your machine by entering </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; which git</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> from the unix command line. If git is installed, this should return a valid path, such as "/usr/bin/git". If this command does not return a valid path, you will need to install or enable a git client before proceeding.</p>
<p>Instructions for installing git on different platforms are given in the documentation on the <a href="http://git-scm.com">git web page</a>, in chapter 1.5 of the Pro Git book by Scott Chacon. If you are using linux, and git is not already installed, you should use the preferred package manager on your linux distribution to install a git client. If you are using a Macintosh, a client should be installed as a component of the XCode app and command line tools, which are needed for other purposes.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_require_python"></a>
Python</h1>
<p>Similarly, one can check if a python interpreter is accessible by checking if the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">\&gt; which python</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> returns a non-empty path.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_require_compiler_serial"></a>
C++ compiler</h1>
<p>By default, the PSCF build system invokes a C++ compiler using the the compiler commnd name "g++". On linux systems, this command normally invokes the gnu compiler collection (gcc) C++ compiler. On a MacIntosh running Mac OS X that is set up for C++ developent (see above), the "g++" command is normally a link to the clang compiler, which is the default compiler for the XCode development environment. The clang compiler accepts almost all the same command line options as the gnu compiler, and thus functions as a drop-in replacement for the gnu C++ compiler.</p>
<p>It is possible to instead configure the build system during the initial setup process so as to use different compiler for C++ files. When the gcc or clang compiler is not used for compilation, however, the PSCF build system will still invoke the "g++" command to use the g++ compiler to analyse dependencies among source files. The PSCF build system thus always requires that the "g++" command be available on the build system.</p>
<p>One can check if the command "g++" exists by entering </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">\&gt; which g++ </div></div><!-- fragment --><p> from a terminal command line. If the "which" utility returns a nonempty path, such as /usr/bin/g++, then the command "g++" exists.</p>
<p>The name of the command used to invoke the compiler when compiling C++ files and the options passed to the compiler can be changed by modifying a compiler setup file that is read during initial setup of the build system. The setup process is described in more detail <a class="el" href="install_setup_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_require_compiler_cuda"></a>
CUDA compiler</h1>
<p>To compile the GPU-accelerated program, the system must also have an appropriate NVIDIA GPU and a CUDA development package installed. The NVIDIA NVCC C++/CUDA compiler is designed to integrate with the GNU g++ compiler, so we recommend using the GNU compiler to compile C++ source files if you are planning to compile CUDA code for use on the same machine.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_require_module"></a>
Software modules (linux clusters)</h1>
<p>At the University of Minnesota, PSCF is often run on a cluster provided by the Minnesota Supercomputer Institute (MSI). The computer clusters at MSI, like many similar clusters, use the linux "module" command to allow users to load particular software packages, including particular choices of compiler. The "module" command is the user interface to the "Modules" package, which is a system for automating changes in a users unix shell environment that are required in order to use particular software packages.</p>
<p>On a system that uses modules, the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; module avail</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> should give a listing of all software modules available for use on a particular system. The syntax for the command to load a particular module is </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; module load  module-name</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> where module-name represents the name of a particular software module, as listed by the "module avail" command.</p>
<p>On the mesabi cluster at MSI, we currently normally set up the compilation environment by invoking </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; module load fftw/3.3.6-<span class="keywordtype">double</span>-gnu-7.2.0</div><div class="line">&gt; module load cuda</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> before compiling PSCF. We use a version of fftw that was compiled with gcc version 7.2.0, rather than then most recent version, because the current version of CUDA (v10.0) isn't compatible with gcc versions with primary version number greater than 7. These module load commands can be entered either from the command line after loggin in entered automatically on login by adding them to the users .bashrc or .profile script.</p>
