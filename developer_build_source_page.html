<p>Almost every subdirectory of the src/ directory tree contain a source list file named "sources.mk". This file is a makefile fragment that is included into other makefiles. The primary purpose of each such file is to maintain a list of all of the compilable source files in that directory. Source list files in namespace-level directories also define a makefile rule for constructing an associated static library.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_list_sources_sec"></a>
Source and object file lists</h1>
<p>Every sources.mk source list file defines a makefile variable whose value is a list of all of the compilable source files that are located in that directory and all of its subdirectories. The name of variable is always a string of the form </p><pre class="fragment">[directory]_
</pre><p> in which the symbol "[directory]" represents a mangled form of the name of the subdirectory of src that contains the source list file. Specifically, the [directory] string in each such variable name is constructed by taking the relative path from the src/ directory to a subdirectory of interest and replacing each "/" directory separator in this path an underscore ("_"). As an example, the file src/pscf/chem/sources.mk defines a variable named </p><pre class="fragment">   pscf_chem_
</pre><p> Here, the directory path pscf/chem defined relative to the src directory has been converted into the variable name pscf_chem_ . The value of this variable is a list of paths to all compilable source files that are located in the directory tree rooted at the directory that contains this sources.mk file. Each path in this list must be given as a relative path, defined relative to the src directory.</p>
<p>Every sources.mk file also defines a second makefile variable with a name of the form [directory]_OBJS that contains a list of paths to corresponding *.o object file targets. For example, the file src/pscf/chem/sources.mk defines a variable named </p><pre class="fragment">pscf_chem_OBJS
</pre><p> The value of this variable is a list of paths to all of the object file targets that are created by compiling source files listed in the list corresponding source file list. Every path in this list must be an absolute path, defined relative to the root of the entire file system.</p>
<p>In what follows, we refer to the [directory]_ variable in each such file as a source file list, and the [directory]_OBJS variable as an object file list. The source file list must be maintained by developers. <br  />
 The object file list is created automatically by applying some simple text manipulation operations to the source file list, as shown below.</p>
<p>In the remainder of this page, we discuss examples of sources.mk source list files located at three different levels of the src directory tree:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directories that are not namespace-level directories, and have no enclosed subdirectories</li>
<li>Directories that are not namespace-level directories, and have enclosed subdirectories</li>
<li>Namepace-level subdirectories of the src directory</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_list_example1_sec"></a>
Directories with no enclosed subdirectories (not namespace-level)</h1>
<p>The simplest type of sources.mk files occur in directories that are are not namespace level directories, but that that contain source files, and do not contain any enclosed subdirectories.</p>
<p><b> Example </b>: As an example of this case, the contents of the file src/pscf/chem/sources.mk is shown below: </p><pre class="fragment">pscf_chem_= \
  pscf/chem/Monomer.cpp \
  pscf/chem/Vertex.cpp \
  pscf/chem/Edge.cpp \
  pscf/chem/Species.cpp \
  pscf/chem/SolventSpecies.cpp \
  pscf/chem/PolymerSpecies.cpp \
  pscf/chem/PolymerType.cpp \
  pscf/chem/PolymerModel.cpp \
  pscf/chem/MixtureBase.cpp \
  pscf/chem/Deby.cpp \
  pscf/chem/VertexIterator.cpp \
  pscf/chem/EdgeIterator.cpp

pscf_chem_OBJS=\
     $(addprefix $(BLD_DIR)/, $(pscf_chem_:.cpp=.o))
</pre><p> The value assigned to pscf_chem_ in this example uses a makefile syntax in which a backslash (\) character is used to continue a statement to the next line. Lines 2 - 12 of this example thus assign a value to pscf_chem that is simply a list of file paths separated by spaces.</p>
<p>The value assigned to pscf_chem_ in this example is a list of all of the compilable source files in the relevant subdirectory, src/pscf/chem. All paths in this list must be given as relative paths, defined relative to the src/ directory. In this example, these source files are all standard C++ source files with a file name suffix .cpp. Source file lists in other directories may, however, also contain CUDA C++ files with file name suffix *.cu.</p>
<p>The object file list variable pscf_chem_OBJS_ is constructed in the last two lines of this example. The value that is assigned to pscf_chem_OBJS is a corresponding list of absolute paths for object files, with filename suffix *.o. This list is constructed here by applying two makefile text manipulation functions to the value of the source file list pscf_chem_. First, the ":" operator is used in the expression $(pscf_chem_:.cpp=.o) to replace the .cpp suffix with .o in each of the relative paths in $(pscf_chem_). The built in "addprefix" function is then used to add the value / as a common prefix to every name in the list. Here,  is the absolute path to the build directory, which is defined in the relevant config.mk configuration file. These manipulations yield a list of absolute paths to all of the *.o object files that should be created by compiling the files in the source file list.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_list_example2_sec"></a>
Directories with subdirectories (not namespace-level)</h1>
<p>We now consider sources.mk file for a subdirectory of src/ that is not a namespace-level directory, but that contains one or more enclosed <br  />
 subdirectories. In this case, the value of the source file list variable [directory]_ must be a list of paths for all of the source files in the directory tree rooted at the directory that contains the source.mk file. This list is created by including source.mk files in enclosed subdirectories and concatenating values of the source file list variables that are defined in those subdirectories.</p>
<p><b> Example </b>: Here is the content of the file src/rpc/fts//sources.mk in a directory src/rpc/fts that contains several subirectories, but that is not a namespace-level directory:</p>
<pre class="fragment"># Include source list files from subdirectories
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/fts/simulator/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/fts/compressor/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/fts/montecarlo/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/fts/brownian/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/fts/perturbation/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/fts/ramp/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/fts/analyzer/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/fts/trajectory/sources.mk

# List of source files in src/rpc/fts
rpc_fts_= \
  $(rpc_fts_simulator_) \
  $(rpc_fts_compressor_) \
  $(rpc_fts_montecarlo_) \
  $(rpc_fts_brownian_) \
  $(rpc_fts_perturbation_) \
  $(rpc_fts_ramp_) \
  $(rpc_fts_analyzer_) \
  $(rpc_fts_trajectory_)

# List of object files in src/rpc/fts
rpc_fts_OBJS=\
     $(addprefix $(BLD_DIR)/, $(rpc_fts_:.cpp=.o))
</pre><p> The first section of this file is a set of include directives that instruct make to include the contents of the sources.mk files from all subdirectories of src/rpc/fts. The make "include" directive is analogous to the C/C++ #include preprocessor command, and simply instructs make to paste the contents of another file into the current file, verbatim, before parsing the current file.</p>
<p>The next section of this file assigns a value to the source file list variable rpc_fts_ by simply concatenating the values of the corresponding source file list variables defined in the enclosed subdirectories. For example, the file scf/rpc/fts/brownian/sources.mk defines a variable rpc_fts_brownian_ whose value is a list of all of the source files in subdirectory src/rpc/fts/brownian. The concatenation of values of these subdirectory source list variables yields a list of paths to all of the source files in the tree rooted at the relevant directory, in which all paths are expressed relative to the src directory.</p>
<p>The statement that defines r1d_OBJS creates a corresponding object file list by processing the source file list, using the same text processing operations as those used in the simpler example given above for a directory with no subdirectories.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_list_example3_sec"></a>
Namespace-level directories</h1>
<p>The source list file in each the namespace-level subdirectory of src contains a rule for constructing an associated static library, in addition to code that constructs source and object file lists.</p>
<p><b> Example </b> : Here is the content of the file src/rpc/sources.mk located in the src/rpc namespace-level directory</p>
<pre class="fragment">#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Source and object file lists for src/rpc

# Include source list files from subdirectories
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/environment/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/field/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/solvers/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/scft/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/fts/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/system/sources.mk

# List of source files in src/rpc
rpc_= \
  $(rpc_environment_) \
  $(rpc_field_) \
  $(rpc_solvers_) \
  $(rpc_scft_) \
  $(rpc_fts_) \
  $(rpc_system_)

# List of object file targets
rpc_OBJS=\
     $(addprefix $(BLD_DIR)/, $(rpc_:.cpp=.o))

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Path and target rule for the librpc.a library

rpc_LIBNAME=rpc
rpc_LIB=$(BLD_DIR)/rpc/lib$(rpc_LIBNAME).a

$(rpc_LIB): $(rpc_OBJS)
   $(AR) rcs $(rpc_LIB) $(rpc_OBJS)

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre><p>The first part of this file, which defines values for rpc_ and rpc_OBJS, is similar to shown in the previous example of a directory that contains subdirectories but is not a namespace-level directory. The only new feature in this example is the section at the end that defines a rule to construct a static library.</p>
<p>The path to the static library file is given by the value of the variable . This is assigned a value $(BLD_DIR)/rpc/librpc.a that gives the absolute path to a file named librpc.a in the rpc subdirectory of the relevant build directory.</p>
<p>The rule to construct the library constructs the target file $(rpc_LIB) by archiving the contents of all of the object files in the src/rpc directory tree. The recipe of this rule variable $(AR) to represent the name of the archiver program that is used for this purpose. The value of AR is defined in the config.mk file in the build directory, and is set to "ar" by default. The resulting library incorporates the contents of all of the object files in the list $(rpc_OBJS).</p>
<p>The sources.mk file in every other namespace-level directory of src defines an analogous rule for constructing a library file. A makefile that includes a sources.mk file located in a namespace-level directory has access to the object file list for that directory, the name of the associated library file, and a rule to construct that library.</p>
