Constrained Partition Functions</h1>
<p >Imagine a process in which we divide an acyclic branched polymer into two discconnected pieces by inserting a two-fold virtual vertex at some point along a particular block and then dividing that block at the added vertex. Doing so creates two new discconnected pieces in which the added vertex at which the polymer was divided becomes a chain end (rather than a junction) within each of the resulting polymer fragments.</p>
<p >Each propagator has a physical interpretation as a normalized constrained partitition function for one of the two segments of polymer that would be created by cutting the bond along which the propagator is defined. Let \( q(\textbf{r}, s) \) denote a propagator that originates at vertex \( A \) of a block of length \( L \) that connects vertices \( A \) and \( B \) within an acylic block polymer. Let \( q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, L-s) \) denote the propagator that is associated with the same block but that originates at vertex \( B \). Imagine that we insert a virtual vertex \( V \) at coordinate \( s \) within this bond, such that the product \( q(\textbf{r}, s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, L-s) \) is the product of incoming propagators at the added vertex, and then divide the polymer at that added vertex. Let \( Z(\textbf{r}, s)\) denote the constrained single-chain partition function of the polymer fragment containing the vertex \( A \) at which propagator \( q \) originates, subject to a constraint created by cutting that block at contour coordinate \( s \), subject to a constraint that the location of chain at end at newly created vertex be constrained to a specified position \( {\bf r}\), while the position of every other point in that segment of polymer is free to fluctuate. This constrained partition function for a branched polymer segment can be defined in a model with discrete point-like beads connected by bonds as an integral of the appropriate Boltzmann weight for this polymer fragment, when beads of each type \( a \) within that polymer fragment are subjected to a potential field \( w_{a}({\bf r}) \), in which the partition function is computed by integrating with respect the positions of all beads in this polymer fragment except the end-bead at vertex \( V \), whose position is treated as a fixed parameter with a value \( \textbf{r} \). <br  />
 Let \( Z_{0}(s) \) denote the corresponding constrained partition function for that chain fragment computed in the absence of any external fields, i.e., computed for a model in which \( w_{a}({\bf r}) = 0\) for all \( {\bf r} \) and all values of the monomer type index \( a \). Note that the quantity \( Z_{0}(s) \) is idependent of position \( {\bf r} \), because all positions are equivalent in a system of non-interacting polymers with no applied external fields. The value \( q(\textbf{r}, s) \) is given by the limit, in the limit of infinitely fine discretization (i.e., an infinite number of beads per block) of the ratio \( Z({\bf r}, s)/Z_{0}({\bf r},s)\). The complementary propagator \( q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r}, L-s) \) for such a bond is instead proportional to the constrained partition function of the other fragment of polymer that is created by cutting the bond between vertices A and B, subject to a constraint that the newly created free end of that segment be constrained to the specified position \( \textbf{r} \).</p>
<p >The product of \( q(\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s) \) of the two incoming propagators associated with a virtual vertex along any bond is proportional to constrained partition function of the entire polymer, subject to a constraint requiring that the monomer that virtual vertex be constrained to a position \( \textbf{r} \). The probability that this point within the polymer would have this position in an equilibrated system containing a single chain moving under the influence of a set of inhomogeneous potentials is thus proportional to this constrained partition function. We thus conclude that the product \( q(\textbf{r},s) q^{\dagger}(\textbf{r},L-s) \) is proportional to the equilibrium probability density for the position of this monomer for a system containing single chain subjected to a set of inhomogeneous potentials.</p>
