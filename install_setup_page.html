</p>
<p >Users must run a bash script named "setup" before attempting to compile any code. This script is located in the pscfpp/ root directory, and should be executed from this directory. The setup script installs several files that are needed to compile pscfpp but that are not created by cloning the github repository. Most of the files installed by this script are files that the user may need to modify in order to customize or extend the package. These include include configuration files that a user may need to modify in order to adapt the simpatico build system to a particular environment or to enable optional features. It is only necessary to invoke the setup script once, before the first time you compile any code.</p>
<p >The most important file created by the setup script is a file named config.mk that is installed the root directory of both the pscfpp/bld and pscfpp/src directory trees. This is a makefile fragment that acts as the main configuration file for compilation. It assigns values to makefile variables that define the compiler executable names for C++ and CUDA code, command line options passed to the compilers, and paths for required external libraries. The copy of this file in pscfpp/bld is the main configuration file for a standard out-of-source build, in which intermediate files are created in the bld/ directory tree. The brief overview of directions for compilation given on a previous page give contain instructions for an out-of-source build, which we recommend for most users who are not working on modifications of the source code. The copy in the pscfpp/src directory is the main configuration file for an in-source build, which is a convenient alternative for use during development.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_setup_default_sec"></a>
Default configuration</h1>
<p >To create a default configuration appropriate for a generic unix-like environment, change directory (cd) to the pscfpp/ root directory, and then enter: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; ./setup</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Note the dot and backslash ("./") before the name of the script. These must be included to tell the unix shell to look for a script named setup in the current working directory, rather than searching the directories listed in the PATH environment variable for a command with this name.</p>
<p >The default configuration should work for either linux or for a Mac with an Intel CPU in which homebrew was used to install GSL and FFTW. The definitions used in the default configuration are defined in a file pscfpp/make/compiler/default.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_setup_homebrewm1_sec"></a>
Macs with Homebrew and Apple Silicon</h1>
<p >To create an environment that should work correctly for a newer Mac with Apple silicon (i.e., the M1 chip) on which Homebrew has used to install dependencies, enter: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; ./setup homebrew-m1</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This will use a compiler setup file pscfpp/make/compiler/homebrew-m1 that was designed for such an environment. This setup file add paths to appropriate subdirectories of /opt/homebrew to the search paths used by the compiler.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_setup_local_file_sec"></a>
Customized configuration</h1>
<p >To create the main config.mk files that are installed in pscfpp/bld and pscfpp/src, the setup script reads a compiler setup file from the pscfpp/make/compiler directory and concatenates it with other makefile fragments. The compiler configuration file is relatively short makefile fragment that contains definitions of makefile variables that define compiler names, compiler options and paths to external libraries.</p>
<p >When the "setup" script is invoked with no argument, as indicated above, the setup script uses a file named pscfpp/make/compiler/default for this purpose. This file contains a default configuration appropriate for a system in which the gnu g++ C++ compiler is used to compile C++ files, the nVidia nvcc compiler is used to compile CUDA files, and paths to the gsl and fftw libraries are in common locations.</p>
<p >When the "setup" script is invoked with one argument, that argument is interpreted as the name of a file in the pscfpp/make/compiler directory that should be used as the compiler configuration file. For example, the command "./setup homebrew-m1" causes the script system to read and copy the contents of the file pscfpp/make/compiler/homebrew-m1. The command "./setup", with no argument, is equivalent to "./setup default".</p>
<p >Users can create customized compiler configuration files to adapt compiler options to their own computer. For example, suppose that a user created a file named pscfpp/make/compiler/local by making a copy of default file with that new name and then editing the variable definitions in that file. Invoking the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">\&gt; ./setup local</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> would then cause the setup script to create config.mk configuration files in the src/ and bld/ directories that both include the contents of the new file make/compiler/local.</p>
<p >In order to create a customized compiler configuration file, a user will need to understand the meanings of some of the variables defined in such files. Toward this end, we recommend that you first run the setup script with no argument and then read the comments in the file bld/config.mk that is created by the setup script. These comments briefly explain the meaning and use of each of the makefile variables. If you compare the resulting file to the file make/compiler/default, you will see that the "default" compiler setup file will have simply been copied into the middle part of the bld/config.mk file.</p>
<p >Users may change values of variables defined in the main configuration file either by creating a customized compiler setup file in the make/compiler directory before running the setup script, as described above, or by directly editing the files bld/config.mk and/or src/config.mk files after running the setup script. The advantages of creating a custom compiler setup file in the make/compiler directory are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes made in customized compiler setup file will be copied to both src/config.mk and bld/config.mk and will thus be used in both in-source and out-of-source builds.</li>
<li>The files src/config.mk and bld/config.mk will be erased if you invoke "make veryclean" to start over with a fresh configuration, but setup files in the make/compiler directory are not erased by the "veryclean" target.</li>
</ul>
<p >We thus recommend that users who need to customize the main config.mk file do so, if possible, by creating a customized compiler setup file.</p>
