<p >The space group of a crystal is a set of symmetry operations under which the structure is invariant. Space group symmetry operatioms generally involve combination of point group operations and translations by fractions of a unit cell. Point group operations involve transformations such as inversion through the origin, reflection through a plane, or rotation around a symmetry axis by some fraction of a full rotation.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_ops_sec"></a>
Crystal Symmetry Operations</h1>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_operation_def"></a><b> Definition (Crystal Symmetry Operation) </b>: Every crystal symmetry operation \( A \) is a function that maps every position \( {\bf r} \) within a crystal onto a new position \( A({\bf r}) \) of the form  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   A({\bf r}) =  R {\bf r} + {\bf t}
\]
</p>
<p> in which \( R \) is an invertible linear operator that acts on the vector \( {\bf r} \) to its right by applying a point group operation (e.g., a reflection, rotation, or inversion), and in which \( {\bf t}\) is a translation vector. The translation vector associated with a space group symmetry operation can be zero, giving a pure point group operation, or can be a sum of translations by rational fractions of a unit cell along Bravais lattice basis vectors.</p>
<p >Notation: Here and hereafter, we use bold faced symbols to denote vectors such as \( {\bf r} \). We define an inner-product space for vectors by defining the dot product \( {\bf a}\cdot{\bf b} \) of two vectors to be given by the usual Euclidean norm computed using a Cartesian vector components. The norm of a vector, denoted by \( |{\bf a}| \), is then given by the Cartesian norm  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
     |{\bf a}| = \sqrt{{\bf a}\cdot{\bf a}}
\]
</p>
<p> The adjoint of any linear operator \( R \) in this vector space is denoted by \( R^{T} \), and is defined by the requirement that <a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_adjoint_def_eqn"></a> </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
  (R^{T}{\bf a}) \cdot {\bf b} = {\bf a} \cdot (R {\bf b})
\]
</p>
<p> for any two D-dimensional vectors \( {\bf a} \) and \( {\bf b} \).</p>
<p >The point group operator \( R \) associated with a crystal symmetry operation is is always an orthogonal operator (i.e., a unitary operator in a real vector space) that does not change the norm of any vector on which it operates. That is, for any point group operator \( R \),  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   |R{\bf v}| = |{\bf v}|
\]
</p>
<p> for any vector \( {\bf v} \).</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_multiplication_def"></a><b> Definition (Multiplication) </b>: Multiplication of symmetry operations is defined such that the product \( AB \) of two symmetry operations \( A \) and \( B \) is the operation whose effect on a vector is given by applying \( B \) followed by \( A \). That is, if \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are crystal symmetry operations, such that  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   C = AB
\]
</p>
<p> then  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
     C({\bf r}) \equiv A(B({\bf r})) \quad.
\]
</p>
<p> Multiplication of symmetry operations is not commutative: Generally, \( AB \neq BA \).</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_multiplication_thrm"></a><b> Theorem (Multiplication Rule) </b>: If \( A \), \( B \) are two symmetry operations  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   A = (R_{A}, {\bf t}_{A}) \quad
   B = (R_{B}, {\bf t}_{B}) \quad
\]
</p>
<p> and \( C = AB \) is their product, then  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   C = AB = (R_{C}, {\bf t}_{C}) \quad,

</p>
<p> with  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   R_{C} = R_{A}R_{B} \quad
   {\bf t}_{C} = {\bf t}_{A} + R_{A}{\bf t}_{B} \quad.
\]
</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: Observe that \( C({\bf r}) = A(B({\bf r})) \) for any vector \( {\bf r} \), and that  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   A(B({\bf r}))
   = A(R_{B}{\bf r} + {\bf t}_{B})
   = R_{A} R_{B} {\bf r} + R_{A} {\bf t}_{B} + {\bf t}_{A} \quad.
\]

<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_identity_def"></a><b> Identity Operation </b>: The identity operation, denoted by \( E \), is the trivial symmetry operation that maps every position onto itself, so that  </p><p class="formulaDsp">

</p>
<p> This is represented by a pair  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   E = (I, 0) \quad,
\]
</p>
<p> in which we use \( I \) to denote the identity point group operation, for which the matrix representation in any basis is an identity matrix. Mutlplication of any other symmetry operation \( A \) by the identity leaves \( A \) unchanged, such that \( EA = AE = A \).</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_identity_thrm"></a><b> Defininition (Inverse) </b>: Every crystal symmetry operation \( A \) has an inverse, denoted by \( A^{-1} \), which is defined such that  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   A^{-1}A = A A^{-1} = E \quad.
\]
</p>
<p> The identity element is equal its own inverse, since \( EE = E \).</p>

\[
   A^{-1} = (R^{-1}, -R^{-1}{\bf t}) \quad.

</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: Use the <a class="el" href="user_symmetry_page.html#user_symmetry_multiplication_thrm">multiplication rule</a> to confirm that \( A^{-1}A = A A^{-1} = (I, 0) = E \).</p>

Space Groups</h1>
<p ><b> Definition (Space Group) </b> A space group \( S \) is a set of crystal symmetry operations for which multiplication is defined as discussed <a class="el" href="user_symmetry_page.html#user_symmetry_multiplication_def">above</a>, and for which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inclusion of identity: \( S \) includes the identity \( E \)</li>
<li>Closure under inversion: If \( S \) contains an element \( A \), \( S \) also contains \( A^{-1} \).</li>
<li>Closure under multiplication: If \( S \) contains \( A \) and \( B \), it also contains the product \( A B \).</li>
</ul>
<p >It is known that there are only 230 possible distinct 3D space groups, 17 possible distinct 2D plane groups, and 2 possible symmetry groups in 1D, as discussed <a class="el" href="user_groups_page.html">here</a>. The data/groups directory contains files that each list all of the symmetry elements for one of these groups.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_components_sec"></a>
Vector Bases</h1>
<p >Different vector bases are used in PSCF for vectors that represent positions or translations and for vectors that represent reciprocal lattice wavevectors.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_components_bravais_sub"></a>
Bravais Basis (Positions and Translations)</h2>
<p >It is convenient for to define components of position vectors such as a position \( {\bf r} \) or a translation \( {\bf t} \) using a basis of Bravais lattice basis vector. We refer to this as a Bravais basis. Any position vector \( {\bf r} \) may be expressed in a Bravais basis as a sum  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
  {\bf r} = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} r_{i}{\bf a}_{i}
\]
</p>
<p> in which \( {\bf a}_{0},\ldots, {\bf a}_{D-1} \) are Bravais lattice basis vectors, while \( r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1} \) are components of \( {\bf r} \) in this basis, also known as reduced coordinates. Similarly, the translational vector \( {\bf t} \) associated with a space group symmetry may be expressed as a sum  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
  {\bf t} = t_{0}{\bf a}_{0} + \cdots t_{D-1}{\bf a}_{D-1}
\]
</p>
<p> in which the components \( t_{0}, \ldots, t_{D-1} \) are all rational numbers (i.e., fractions) with small denominators, such as \( \pm 1/2 \), \( 1/4 \), \( 2/3 \), etc.</p>
<p >Notation: Here and hereafer, we use a notation in which the components of a vector \( {\bf a} \) in a specified basis are denoted by subscripted variables \( a_{0}, \ldots, a_{D-1} \), using bold- and non-bold faced versions of the same symbol for a vector and its components.</p>
<p >A representation of a point group operator \( R \) as a matrix may be defined by using a Bravais basis to define the components of the vector \( R{\bf r} \) for any vector \( {\bf r} \). This gives a representation of \( R{\bf r} \) as a sum  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   R {\bf r} =
   \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} \sum_{j=0}^{D-1}
   {\bf a}_{i} R_{ij} r_{j}
\]
</p>
<p> where \( (r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) \) are components of \( {\bf r} \) and \( R_{ij} \) denotes a matrix element of \( R \) in a Bravais basis. The matrix representation of a point group operation in a Bravais basis must have matrix elements that are all integers (usually 0, 1, or -1), in order to guarantee that this operation maps all Bravais lattice vectors onto other Bravais lattice vectors.</p>
<p >PSCF stores the representation of each symmetry operation \( A \) internally as a pair  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
    A = ( R, {\bf t})
\]
</p>
<p> in which \( R \) is represented as a \( D \times D \) matrix with integer matrix elements and \( {\bf t} \) represented as a vector with \( D \) components that is represented as a rational number (i.e., ratio of two integers). Each space group symmetry is represented as an instance of a class Pscf::SpaceSymmetry&lt;D&gt;. Each element of the translation vector \( {\bf t} \) is represented by an instance of class <a class="el" href="classUtil_1_1Rational.html" title="A Rational number (a ratio of integers).">Util::Rational</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_components_reciprocal_sub"></a>
Reciprocal Basis (Wavevectors)</h2>
<p >It is convenient to express reciprocal lattice wavevectors in a basis of reciprocal lattice basis vectors, which we refer to as a reciprocal basis. In this representation, each reciprocal lattice wavevector \( G \) is expressed as a linear combination  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
  {\bf G} = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} G_{i}{\bf b}_{i}
\]
</p>
<p> in which \( {\bf b}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf b}_{D-1} \) are reciprocal lattice basis vectors, defined such that  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
  {\bf a}_{i}\cdot{\bf b}_{j} = 2\pi \delta_{ij} \quad,
\]
</p>
<p> for all \( i, j = 0, \ldots, D-1\), and in which \( G_{0}, \ldots, G_{D-1} \) are integer components (Miller indices).</p>
<p >When a reciprocal basis is used for a wavevectors \( {\bf G} \) and a Bravais basis is used for a position \( {\bf r} \), then the dot product \( {\bf G}\cdot{\bf r} \) may be expressed as a sum  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   {\bf G} \cdot {\bf r}
   = 2\pi \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} G_{i} r_{i} \quad,
\]
</p>
<p> where \( G_{0}, \ldots, G_{D-1} \) are the integer components of \( {\bf G} \) in a reciprocal basis and \( r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1} \) are reduced coordinates of \( {\bf r} \).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="user_symmetry_adjoint_matrix_sub"></a>
Adjoint Operators in Wavevector Space</h2>
<p >Suppose that \( {\bf G} \) is a reciprocal lattice vector, \( R \) is a linear operator that can be applied to a position vector, and  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
  {\bf G}&#39; = R^{T}{\bf G}
\]
</p>
<p> is a wavevector obtained by applying the adjoint operator \( R^{T} \) to \( {\bf G} \). To define \( R^{T}{\bf G} \), we must consider the dot product of \( {\bf G} \) with \( R {\bf r} \) for arbitrary \( {\bf G} \) and \( {\bf r} \) . By using a basis of reciprocal lattice basis vectors for \( {\bf G} \) a basis of Bravais lattice basis vectors for \( R{\bf r} \), we may show  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   {\bf G} \cdot R {\bf r} = 2\pi
   \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} \sum_{j=0}^{D-1} G_{i}R_{ij}r_{j}
\]
</p>
<p> for any \( {\bf G} \) and \( {\bf r} \) and \( (r_{0}, \ldots, r_{D-1}) \) are components defined using reciprocal and Bravais lattice basis vectors, respectively. Comparing this to the definition of an adjoint, we conclude that \( {\bf G}&#39; \) may be expanded as a sum  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
  {\bf G}&#39; = \sum_{j=0}^{D-1} G_{j}&#39; {\bf b}_{j}
\]
</p>
<p> with components  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
  G_{j}&#39;
  = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} G_{i} R_{ij} = \sum_{i=0}^{D-1} R_{ji}^{T} G_{i}
  \quad.
\]
</p>
<p> The matrix representation of the operator \( R^{T} \) in a reciprocal basis (which we use for wavevectors), is thus given by the transpose of the matrix representation of \( R \) in a Bravais basis.</p>
