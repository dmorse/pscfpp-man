<p >This page describes the commands accepted by the pscf_fd program. We begin by showing simple examples of complete command files.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_example_sec"></a>
Example: SCFT Calculation</h1>
<p >Here is a example of a command file for a single SCFT calculation performed with pscf_fd. The example assumes the use of a convention for locations of input and output files in which the initial guess for the w field is located in a subdirectory of the current working directory named "in", and in which all outputs are written to files in a subdirectory named "out". <br  />
 </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">READ_W        in/w</div>
<div class="line">ITERATE       </div>
<div class="line">WRITE_W       out/w</div>
<div class="line">WRITE_C       out/c</div>
<div class="line">WRITE_PARAM   out/data</div>
<div class="line">WRITE_THERMO  out/data</div>
<div class="line">FINISH</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The effect of each command in this example is described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The command "READ_W in/w" reads the file in/w, which contains an initial guess for the chemical potential field, and save it to memory.</li>
<li>The command ITERATE runs an iterative solver that attempts to solve the self-consistent field equations, starting from the initial guess that was provided by the READ_W command.</li>
<li>"WRITE_W out/w" writes the resulting converged set of chemical potential fields to the file out/w.</li>
<li>"WRITE_C out/c" writes the corresponding monomer volume fraction fields to the file out/c.</li>
<li>"WRITE_PARAM out/data" writes the parameter file for this solution to the file out/data, to provide a record of the input parameters.</li>
<li>"WRITE_THERMO out/data" appends information about thermodynamic properties of the converged solution to the end of file out/data.</li>
<li>FINISH instructs the main program to stop execution and return.</li>
</ul>
<p >All pscf_fd that read or write field files use the same field file format, described <a class="el" href="user_field_fd1d_page.html">here</a>. The last line in every PSCF command script must be a FINISH command. Anything that appears after the FINISH command will be ignored.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_sweep_sec"></a>
Example: A Sweep</h1>
<p >Here is an example of a command file to perform a sweep. The SWEEP command can only be used if the parameter file that was read by pscf_fd before reading this command file contains an appropriate Sweep block. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">READ_W    in/w</div>
<div class="line">SWEEP</div>
<div class="line">FINISH</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The command "READ_W_BASIS in/w.bf" instructs the program to read an initial guess for the chemical potentials fields at the initial state of the sweep (the state s=0) from the file in/w.bf. <br  />
 The SWEEP command actually executes the sweep operation.</p>
<p >Note that this example command file for a sweep does not contain any of the explicit output commands that are shown as part of the example for a single SCFT calculation. These output commands are unnecessary for a sweep because information about the solution at each step in the sweep is instead automatically output as part of the implementation of the sweep operation. Adding output commands that output data after the SWEEP command would in any case only output information that describes the solution for the final state point of the sweep, for which s=1.</p>

<p >Individual commands and related groups of commands are discuss below in greater detail:</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_input_sec"></a>
Field Input</h1>
<p >The first command in a command file is usually a READ_W command, which takes the name of an input file as an argument. This command reads an initial guess for the chemical potential fields ("w fields") from the specified file and assigns the current values for these fields equal to the values read from this file.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_computation_sec"></a>
Computation</h1>
<p >The COMPUTE, ITERATE and SWEEP commands each perform a computation that requires an initial guess for the w fields as an input. Each of these commands must thus be preceded by a READ_W command that initializes the w fields.</p>
<p >The COMPUTE command performs a computation of the single molecule partition functions and monomer concentrations for a system of non-interacting molecules subjected to the current w-fields. This requires a solution of the modified diffusion equations for both directions for all blocks of each polymeric species and a simpler calculation of concentrations for each solvent species. The COMPUTE command does not modify the w fields, but does modify the volume fraction fields (c fields) associated with polymer blocks, solvent species and monomer types. The resulting c fields generally do not satisfy the self-consistenct field conditions.</p>
<p >The ITERATE command attempts to obtain a solution to the self-consistent field equations for a fixed set of parameters by iteratively adjusting the w fields. The choice of iteration algorithm is specified by the Iterator block of the parameter file. Each iteration usually requires at least one calculation similar to that performed once by the COMPUTE command.</p>
<p >THE SWEEP command attempts to solve the SCFT equations at a sequence of points along a path through the space of possible choices of input parameters. This command can only be invoked if the parameter file contains a SWEEP block, which defines the desired sequence of state points.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_dataout_sec"></a>
Data Output</h1>
<p >The WRITE_PARAM and WRITE_THERMO commands can be used to create a record of the input parameters and computed thermodynamic properties associated with a single SCFT calculation.</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_param_sub"></a> The WRITE_PARAM writes a slightly modified copy of the parameter file to a file whose name is given as a command parameter. The version of the parameter file written by this command outputs the current values for all parameters, and excludes any Sweep block.</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_thermo_sub"></a> The WRITE_THERMO command outputs a report of values for thermodynamic properties obtained after solution of a SCFT problem. The resulting report includes values for the <a class="el" href="user_model_page.html#user_model_helmholtz_sub">Helmholtz free energy per monomer</a> \( \tilde{f} \) , denoted by "fHelmholtz" in the output file, the <a class="el" href="user_model_page.html#user_model_pressure_sub">nondimensionalized pressure</a> \( \tilde{p} \), denoted by "pressure", the chemical potential and volume fraction of each polymer and solvent molecular species, denoted by "mu" and "phi". All free energies, pressure and chemical potential values are output using thermal energy units, in which \( k_{B}T = 1 \).</p>
<p >If the file whose name is passed to the WRITE_THERMO command already exists, the report of thermodynamic properties will be appended to the end of this file, rather than overwriting the file. This is designed to allow users to output a parameter file block that contains the input parameters followed by a report of computed thermodynamic properties in a single file, if desired, by invoking WRITE_PARAM and WRITE_THERMO with the same file name parameter. The example command file shown above uses this pattern, by providing the same filename "out/data" as a parameter for both the WRITE_PARAM and WRITE_THERMO commands.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_fieldout_sec"></a>
Field Output</h1>
<p >The following commands can be used to output information about chemical potential and concentration fields after solving a SCFT problem.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WRITE_W</b> : Writes the current chemical potential fields (w fields) for all monomer types to an output file whose name is specified as a command parameter.</li>
<li><b>WRITE_C</b> : Writes the current volume fraction / concentration fields for all monomer types to a specified output file.</li>
<li><b>WRITE_C_BLOCK</b> : Writes the current volume fraction / concentration fields for all polymer blocks and monomer species to a single file, with the field associated with each block or solvent species written in a different column.</li>
</ul>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_writecblock_sub"></a> The information provided by the WRTIE_C_BLOCK command is different than and more detailed than that provided by the WRITE_C command when applied to systems in which the same monomer type id is assigned to two or more blocks (on the same or different polymers) and/or solvent species. The file output by this command contains a header section identical to that contained in any pscf_fd field file, followed by a data section. The format of the data section file is analogous to that of pscf_fd field file that contains one field per monomer type, except that each polymer block and solvent species is treated as a separate monomer type, and thus output in a separate column of the data section. <br  />
</p>
<p >Columns associated with blocks and species are output by the WRITE_C_BLOCK command are listed from left to right in the same order that they appear in the parameter file: Columns associated with polymer blocks are listed first (i.e., to the left), followed by columns associated with solvent species. Columns associated with blocks of the same polymer appear sequentially in order of increasing block id, while groups of columns associated with different polymer species appear in order of increasing polymer id. Columns associated with solvent species appear after polymer blocks, listed left to right in order of increasing polymer id.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_mesh_sec"></a>
Mesh Manipulation</h1>
<p >The REMESH_W and EXTEND_W can be used to change the mesh used to define a problem, by changing resolution or extending the domain.</p>
<p >The REMESH_W command allows a user to change the discretization of the existing domain by writing a file that contains the current w fields interpolated onto a mesh with a modified number of grid points. The command takes the number nx of grid points of the new mesh and the name of the output file as parameters.</p>
<p >The EXTEND_W command allows a user to extend the domain of the solution by adding new points with field values that are simply copies of the values of w fields at the last grid point. The command takes the number m of added grid points and the name of the output file as parameters.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_command_fd_comparison_sec"></a>
Compare to Homogeneous Reference</h1>
<p >The COMPARE_HOMOGENEOUS command computes differences between properties of an inhomogeneous system of interest, as predicted by SCFT, and those of an homogeneous reference system. The command takes an integer mode parameter with allowed values 0, 1, and 2 that determines the nature of the homogeneous system used for this comparison. In mode 0 (i.e., when mode == 0), the inhomogeneous system is compared to a homogeneous system with a composition equal to the spatial average composition of the system of interest. In modes 1 and 2, the comparison is made to a homogeneous system in which chemical potentials for all species are equal to those of the system of interest. <br  />
</p>
<p >Further details of the operation of this command are described in a separate page <a class="el" href="user_command_fd_homo_page.html">here</a>. These details include a description of the difference between modes 1 and 2 and a discussion of the format of the resulting report.</p>
