<p>The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs accept identical set of commands, which are described on this page. These programs for periodic systems accept a larger set of commands than the simpler pscf_1d program, though many basic commands are similar. The number of available commands is larger, in part, as a result of the fact that pscf_pc and pscf_pg can read and write several different formats for field files. By convention, the names of commands that read or write a field file in symmetry-adapted basis format end with a suffix _BASIS, while names of commands that read or write files in read-space grid (r-grid) format end with a suffic _RGRID. The pscf_pc and pscf_pg programs also accept a set of commands that can be used convert between different possible field file formats.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_scft_sec"></a>
Example: SCFT calculation</h1>
<p>Below is an example of a simple command file for using pscf_pc to perform a single SCFT calculation, using field files and an iterator algorithm that impose a specified space group symmetry that must be declared in the parameter file. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">READ_W_BASIS    in/w.bf</div>
<div class="line">ITERATE</div>
<div class="line">WRITE_W_BASIS   out/w.bf</div>
<div class="line">WRITE_C_BASIS   out/c.bf</div>
<div class="line">WRITE_C_RGRID   out/c.rf</div>
<div class="line">WRITE_PARAM     out/data</div>
<div class="line">WRITE_THERMO    out/data</div>
<div class="line">FINISH</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The command "READ_W_BASIS in/w.bf" reads an initial guess for the chemical potentials fields from the file in/w.bf, which must contain the components of the fields in "basis" format, as coefficients in an expansion in a symmetry-adapted Fourier basis. The ITERATE command attempts to iteratively solve the SCFT equations starting from this initial guess, using the iterator algorithm specified in the parameter file. The command "WRITE_W_BASIS out/w.bf" writes the resulting converged set of chemical potential fields to file out/w.bf in symmetry-adapted basis format. The command "WRITE_C_BASIS out/c.bf" writes the corresponding monomer volume fraction fields to the file out/c.bf in the same format, while "WRITE_C_RGRID out/c.rf" writes the volume fraction fields in r-grid format, which can be used for subsequent visualization. The command "WRITE_PARAM out/data" writes a param file for the current system to the file out/data. The command, "WRITE_THERMO out/data", appends the thermodynamic properties of the converged solution to the end of the same file. The FINISH command instructs the main program to finish execution and return.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_ex_sweep_sec"></a>
Example: SCFT sweep</h1>
<p>Here is an example of a minimal command file to perform an SCFT parameter sweep. </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">READ_W_BASIS    in/w.bf</div>
<div class="line">SWEEP</div>
<div class="line">FINISH</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The command "READ_W_BASIS in/w.bf" reads an initial guess for the chemical potentials fields at the initial state of the sweep (the state s=0) from the file in/w.bf. The SWEEP command actually performs a parameter sweep. The FINISH command halts execution of the main program.</p>
<p>The parameter file used to initialize a parameter sweep must contain an Iterator block and a Sweep block. The Sweep block defines the desired sequence of state points (i.e., choices of parameter values), while the Iterator block determines the behavior of the iteration algorithm used to solve the SCF equations at each state point.</p>
<p>The minimal command file required for a sweep is somewhat simpler than the corresponding command file for single SCFT calculation because the former does not contain any commands to output data associated with the converged solution. This is possible because the required data output operations are programmed to occur automatically at the end of each step in the sweep.</p>

<p>The following table shows a list of available commands for pscf_pc or pscf_pg that are relevant to SCFT calculations. A few additional commands that are only relevant to PS-FTS calculations are discussed on a <a class="el" href="psfts_command_page.html">separate page</a> within the manual chapter that discusses such simulations.</p>

<p>Further discussion of particular commands and groups of commands is provided below.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_fieldin_sec"></a>
W field initialization</h1>
<p>The READ_W_BASIS, and READ_W_RGRID commands allow a user to set or reset the w fields that are stored in program memory. The READ_W_BASIS command reads files in symmetry-adapted basis format. The READ_W_RGRID command reads w files in real-space grid (r-grid) format, which does not require the fields to have any particular space group symmetry. One of these commands must be invoked to initialize the w fields before invoking any of the computation commands. The w fields must normally be initialized by the READ_W_BASIS command prior to any operation which assumes the existence of a specified space group symmetry.</p>
<p>Each of these two field initialization commands reads a field file that contains a header section that includes information about the crystallographic unit cell and the space group name, as well as the number of monomer types. The description of the unit cell type and space group name given in this header section must match those declared in the parameter file, as must the value of the number of monomer types. Each of these two commands sets or resets the values of unit cell parameters that are stored in program memory, by setting them equal to the values that are given in this field file header.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_readwbasis_sub"></a><b> READ_W_BASIS</b>: The READ_W_BASIS command reads the coefficients of an expansion of the w fields in a symmetry-adapted Fourier basis from an input file whose name is specified as command parameter.</p>
<p>The code that reads files in basis format can read files that were generated for a structure that has the space group symmetry declared in the parameter file but that is defined on a different computation mesh, with different number of grid points along each direction, than that described by the "mesh" parameter in the parameter file. This code initializes to zero the coefficients of any basis function that exists in the current basis (which is created for the mesh declared in the parameter file) but does appear in the input file. It also ignores values for coefficients of basis functions that appear in the input file but that do not exist in the current basis.</p>
<p><em>Technical note</em> : The symmetry-adapted basis used by pscf_pc is normally created during the process of reading the first field file that that the program is instructed to read. This basis is constructed immediately after reading the header of that file, which contains a list of values for the unit cell parameters. Initialization of the basis is delayed until this point in program execution because values for unit cell parameters are not provided in the parameter file, and required by the algorithm that creates this basis. The choice of the initial values for the unit cell parameters that are obtained in this way can affect the order in which basis functions are listed internally, because the basis functions are symmetry-adapted eigenvalues of the Laplacian that are listed in an order of non-decreasing eigenvalues (or non-decreasing wavenumber) at the time of creation. The set of basis functions that is created for a particular mesh and space group is, however, independent of the values of the unit cell parameter values that were used to create this order during creation of the basis.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_readwrgrid_sub"></a><b> READ_W_RGRID </b>: The READ_W_RGRID command reads the values of w fields in real-space grid (r-grid) format from an input file. The header of the an r-grid field file contains a description of the mesh, defined by the number of grid points in each direction. These values must exactly equal the values given in the parameter file by the elements of the "mesh" parameter, or the program will output an error message and stop execution.</p>
<p>The READ_W_RGRID command cannot be used to initialize w fields for subsequent use in an SCFT simulation of a structure with a specified symmetry, for reasons that are explained below. Users who wish to perform an SCFT calculation for a structure with a specified space group should thus initialize the w fields using either the READ_W_BASIS command, rather than READ_W_RGRID. The r-grid file format can represent a field with no particular space group symmetry. When w fields are read in r-grid format using this command, pscf_pc thus assumes that the w fields and any fields that are computed from them may not be symmetric under the elements of the space group declared in the parameter file. Because the existing iteration algorithms for pscf_pc all use an expansion of the fields in symmetry-adapted basis, the ITERATE and SWEEP command thus cannot be invoked when the current w fields were initialized using the READ_W_RGRID command. W fields that were initialize with the READ_W_RGRID command may, however, be used by the COMPUTE command, which uses an algorithm that does not assume the existence of any space group symmetry.</p>
<p>The READ_W_RGRID command is thus currently of very limited utility in pscf_pc. It was implemented as a starting point for later development of stochastic field theoretic simulation algorithms in which the fluctuating field generally do not exhibit any special symmetry.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_unitcell_sec"></a>
Unit Cell Initialization</h1>
<p>The SET_UNIT_CELL command can be used to set or reset the parameters (lengths and angles) of the periodic unit cell. It is usually not necessary, however, to use this command to set unit cell parameters because these parameters are also set to the values given in a field file header whenever the READ_W_BASIS or READ_W_RGRID command is used to read W fields from a file. The SET_UNIT_CELL provides an alternate mechanism to set these parameters, in order to manually override values that previously been read from a field file, or to set initial unit cell parameters prior to reading a field file.</p>
<p>The SET_UNIT_CELL command take a string argument that must be the name name of a lattice type of the appropriate dimension (e.g., cubic, for a system with D=3) by a followed by a list of unit cell parameter values (one or more lengths, and sometimes angles). The lattice type string argument must match the lattice parameter given in the Domain section of the parameter file. The number and interpretation of the unit cell parameter values depends on the lattice type, as discussed <a class="el" href="prdc_unitcell_page.html">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_compute_sec"></a>
SCFT Computations</h1>
<p>The COMPUTE, ITERATE and SWEEP commands perform the primary computations involved in a self-consistent field calculation. Each performs the same operation as the analogous command for the pscf_1d program. Each of these commands requires an initialized set of w fields and unit cell parameters as an input, which must have been initialized by a previous call to READ_W_BASIS or READ_W_RGRID.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_compute_sub"></a><b> COMPUTE </b>: The COMPUTE command solves solves the single molecule statistical mechanics problem for all polymer and solvent species for a system of non-interacting molecules subjected to the current w-fields. This modifies the current c-fields stored in program memory, but does not modify the w fields.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_iterate_sub"></a><b> ITERATE </b>: The ITERATE command attempts to iteratively solve the self self-consistent field equations for a fixed set of input parameters, and may optionally modify the unit cell parameter so as to minimize the Helmholtz free energy density. The associated parameter file must contain an Iterator block, which specifies the choice of SCFT iteration algorithm and any parameters required by that algorithm. Parameters of required by the iteration algorithm generally include an error tolerance "epsilon" and a boolean "isFlexible" flag that determines whether the iteration algorithm treat the unit cell as flexible (isFlexible == true) or rigid (isFlexible == false). Iteration modifies the current w fields (i.e., the fields that are stored in program memory), and modifies the unit cell parameters if and only if the unit cell is treated as flexible. The w fields and unit cell parameters that are in memory on entry to iteration are used as initial guesses.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_sweep_sub"></a><b> SWEEP </b>: THE SWEEP command attempts to solve the SCFT equations at a sequence of points along a path through the space of possible choices of input parameters. This command may only be invoked if the parameter file contains an Iteration block and Sweep block. The Sweep block defines the desired sequence of state points (i.e., choices of parameter values). The SWEEP command uses the current w fields and unit cell parameters as initial guesses for the first state point in the sequence, and then generates initial guesses for subsequent points by extrapolation of the solutions obtained at previous points.</p>

Data output commands</h1>
<p>The WRITE_PARAM and WRITE_THERMO commands can be used to create a record of the input parameters and computed thermodynamic properties associated with an SCFT calculation.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_param_sub"></a><b> WRITE_PARAM </b>: The WRITE_PARAM writes a slightly modified copy of the parameter file to a file whose name that is specified as a command parameter. The version of the parameter file written by this command outputs the current values for all parameters, and excludes any Sweep block. The output of this command is designed to serve as a record of the input parameters associated with a single SCFT calculation.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_thermo_sub"></a><b> WRITE_THERMO </b>: The WRITE_THERMO command outputs a report of values for thermodynamic properties obtained after solution of a SCFT problem. The details of the output of this command can be found on the <a class="el" href="scft_thermo_page.html">Thermodynamic Properties</a> page.</p>
<p>If the file whose name is passed to the WRITE_THERMO command already exists, the report of thermodynamic properties will be appended to the end of this file, rather than overwriting the file. This is designed to allow users to output a parameter file block that contains the input parameters followed by a report of computed thermodynamic properties in a single file, if desired, by invoking WRITE_PARAM and WRITE_THERMO with the same file name parameter.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_stress_sub"></a><b> WRITE_STRESS </b>: The WRITE_STRESS command outputs a report of values of derivatives of the SCFT free energy with respect to unit cell parameters. These derivatives should be zero to within numerical error for a converged SCFT solution of a problem with a flexible unit cell, for which the unit cell parameters should minimize the free energy, but are generally nonzero for the solution of an SCFT problem in a rigid unit cell. Results are derivatives of the Helmholtz free energy per monomer (as output by the WRITE_THERMO command) with respect to unit cell parameters. These derivatives are listed the conventional order of the unit cell parameters for the relevant lattice type, as described <a class="el" href="prdc_unitcell_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In a system that contains an <a class="el" href="scft_environment_page.html">Environment</a>, the environment-modified stresses are also written, if they were calculated. These stresses take into account the presence of a mask and/or external field in the stress calculation, and may perform additional modifications so that the stress can minimize a property other than the Helmholtz free energy per monomer. The specific meaning of an environment-modified stress depends on the type of Environment, as documented <a class="el" href="scft_environment_page.html">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p>As with WRITE_THERMO, if the file passed to WRITE_STRESS already exists, then the stress data will be appended to the end of this file.</p>

Field output commands</h1>
<p>The WRITE_W_BASIS, WRITE_W_RGRID, WRITE_C_BASIS, and WRITE_C_RGRID can be used to output the current w fields or c fields associated with all different monomer types. The suffix in these command names specifies the file format: Commands with names that end in BASIS output fields in basis format, and commands with names that end in RGRID output fields in r-grid format. In what follows, we use FORMAT to mean a suffix that has allowed values BASIS and RGRID.</p>
<p><b> WRITE_W_(FORMAT) </b>: The WRITE_W_BASIS and WRITE_W_RGRID commands output the current w fields (monomer chemical potential fields) to a specified output file in basis or rgrid format, respectively.</p>
<p><b> WRITE_C_(FORMAT) </b>: The WRITE_W_BASIS and WRITE_W_RGRID commands output the current c fields (volume fraction fields) to a specified output file in basis or rgrid format.</p>
<p>Fields can be output in symmetry-adapted basis format only if those fields are known to have the specified space group symmetry. This symmetry is known to exist for w fields if and only if they were initialized using the READ_W_BASIS command and subsequently modified only by iteration algorithms that maintain space group symmetry. Symmetry is assumed to exist for c fields only if the c fields were computed from w fields that are known to be symmetric.</p>
<p>Fields that represent states in a field theoretic MC or BD simulation must be input and output using the RGRID format.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writeblockc_sub"></a><b> WRITE_BLOCK_C_RGRID </b>: The WRITE_BLOCK_C_RGRID command outputs the current volume fraction fields (c-fields) for all blocks of all polymers and for all solvent species r-grid format as separate fields within a single file. The resulting file has a data section analogous to that produced by the <a class="el" href="#scft_command_pc_writeblockc_sub">WRITE_BLOCK_C</a> command of the pscf_1d program. The resulting file contains a header section identical to that contained in any r-grid field file, followed by a data section. The format of the data section is similar to that of an r-grid field file that contain one field per monomer type, except that each polymer block and solvent species is treated as a separate monomer type, and thus output in a separate column of the data section. Blocks and solvent species are output in the order in which they appear within the parameter file, as in the output of the <a class="el" href="scft_command_1d_page.html#scft_command_1d_writeblockc_sub">WRITE_BLOCK_C</a> command of the pscf_1d program.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_qout_sec"></a>
Propagator output</h1>
<p>In the inner loop of a SCFT calculation, a modified diffusion equation (MDE) is solved within every block of every polymer to obtain a set of so-called propagator functions. Each polymer block has two associated propagator functions, each associated with one of the two directions in which the block can be traversed. Each propagator function \( q({\bf r}, s) \) is a function of position \( {\bf r} \) and a contour variable \( s \) measured within a block as a contour distance from the vertex at which the propagator originates. Each such propagator function is associated with a particular direction (identified by index id = 0 or 1), a particular block (block index ib), and a particular polymer (polymer index ip). We refer to the function of position alone that is obtained by evaluating a propagator at a fixed value of \( s \) as a "slice". Because the MDE for each such propagator is computed numerically at evenly spaced values of \( s \), a computationally accessible slice may be identified by a integer contour step index \( is \) that is equal to zero at the vertex at which the propagator originates, and increases with increasing distance \( s \) from that vertex.</p>
<p>The pscf_pc program accepts several commands that output propagators and propagator slices to one or more files. The names for these commands start with a string "WRITE_Q", followed by a suffix that describes what information is output by invoking the command. All of these commands take a filename string as a parameter, and all but one of them take values of several integer indices needed to identify a particular propagator or slice.</p>
<p>All of these commands use file formats that report values of slices on the nodes of the regular real-space grid that is used internally in computations, analogous to the r-grid file format for w and c fields. The file format always starts with a header section identical to that of an r-grid field file, followed by a data section in which the values of each slice are output in a format analogous to that of a r-grid field file for a system with only one monomer type, in which all values are output in a single column, with nodes listed in the same order as in an r-grid field file.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writeqslice_sub"></a> <b> WRITE_Q_SLICE </b>: The command WRITE_Q_SLICE write the values of a propagator slice at a specified contour variable index \( is \) to an output file. This command named must be followed by the name of the output file, and values for the polymer index \( ip \), the block index \( ib \) and the direction index \( id \), in that order. The data section for output by this function is the same as that of an r-grid field file for a system with one monomer type.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writeqtail_sub"></a> <b> WRITE_Q_TAIL </b>: The command WRITE_Q_TAIL write the values of the propagator slice at a value of \( s \) equal to the length of the block, corresponding to the slice evaluated at the vertex at which the propagator terminates. This command named must be followed by the name of the output file, and values for the polymer index \( ip \) and the block index \( ib \), in that order. The resulting output file has the same format as that used by WRITE_Q_SLICE.</p>
<p>Users may instead output the value of slice of a propagator corresponding to the vertex at which it originates (i.e., the propagator "head" rather than "tail"), by invoking WRITE_Q_SLICE with a contour variable index \( is = 0 \), corresponding to a contour variable \( s = 0 \),</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writeq_sub"></a> <b> WRITE_Q </b>: The command WRITE_Q writes all slices of a specified propagator to a single file. This command name must be followed by the name of the output file and values for the polymer index \( ip \) and block index \( ib \), in that order.</p>
<p>The output file produced by this command contains a header section followed by a sequence of data sections, in which each data section contains the data for a single slice at an integer value of the countour variable index. Data sections are listed in order of increasing countour variable index. The header section is similar to that of an r-grid file, except for the addition of line at the end that contain the word "nslice" followed by the value of the number of slices. Each data section begins with a line containing the word "slice" followed by value of the contour variable index for the slice represented by that section. The value of the slice index ranges from 0 for the first slice (the "head") to nslice - 1 for the last (the "tail"). The format of the remainder of each data section is the same as that of the data section of an r-grid field file for a system containing one monomer type, which consists of a single column of numbers containing the values of the associated propagator slice on the nodes of the regular spatial mesh used throughout the computation.</p>
<p><em> Comment for readers who read the source code </em>: This command calls the function Rpc::System::writeQ, which defines the output format, and is defined in the C++ file src/rpc/System.tpp.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writeqall_sub"></a> <b> WRITE_Q_ALL </b>: The command WRITE_Q_ALL writes all slices of every propagator of every polymer to a set of files, with all the slices of each propagator written to a single file, but different propagators output in different files. This command name must be followed by the value of a string parameter "basename" that contains a common prefix for the names of the resulting file set of output files.</p>
<p>Each of files created by this command has the same format as that of a file created by the <a class="el" href="#scft_command_pc_writeq_sub">WRITE_Q</a> command. The name of the file containing the propagator associated with polymer ip, block ib, and direction id is given by a string of the form (basename)_(ip)_(ib)_(id).rf, where (basename) denotes the value of the basename command parameter, and where (ip), (ib), and (id) denote string representations of the values of the non-negative integers ip, ib, and id. Thus, for example, if the command is passed a basename parameter out/q, then the file out/q_0_2_1.rf will contain all slices of the propagator associated with polymer 0, block 2 and direction 1.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_crystal_sec"></a>
Crystallographic information</h1>
<p>The commands WRITE_WAVES and WRITE_STARS allow the user to output information about the symmetry-adapted basis that program has constructed for space group and mesh specified in the parameter file. The command WRITE_GROUP outputs all of the symmetry operations of the space group.</p>
<p>The symmetry-adpated basis used by PSCF is constructed by identifying sets of allowed wavevectors that are related by symmetry, which we refer to as "stars", and constructing a basis function associated with each star as linear superpositions of planes waves with wavevectors that belong to that star. The coefficients of plane waves associated with wavevectors within such superposition are complex numbers with the same absolute magnitude and relative phases (i.e., differences between complex arguments) that are determined by the requirement that each such function be invariant under all operations of the specified space group.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writewaves_sub"></a><b> WRITE_WAVES</b>: The WRITE_WAVES command outputs an ordered list of unique wavevectors that can appear in the expansion of a function with the specified space group symmetry, with associated information about each wavevector. The name of this command must be followed by the name of the file to which this listing should be written. The format of the file created by this command is discussed <a class="el" href="scft_command_pc_wave_page.html">here</a> .</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writestars_sub"></a><b> WRITE_STARS</b>: The WRITE_STARS command outputs a list of information about stars, or associated basis functions. The name of this command must be followed by the name of the file to which this listing should be written. The format of the file created by this command is discussed <a class="el" href="scft_command_pc_star_page.html">here</a> .</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writegroup_sub"></a><b> WRITE_GROUP</b>: The WRITE_GROUP command outputs a list of all of the symmetry operations in the space group to a file. The name of the output file is given as a command argument that follows the command name. The format of the file created by this command is discussed <a class="el" href="scft_command_pc_group_page.html">here</a> .</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_fieldconvert_sec"></a>
Field File Format Conversions</h1>
<p>The 6 commands <b>BASIS_TO_RGRID</b>, <b>RGRID_TO_BASIS</b>, <b>KGRID_TO_RGRID</b>, <b>RGRID_TO_KGRID</b>, <b>BASIS_TO_KGRID</b>, and <b>KGRID_TO_BASIS</b> each reads a field file containing a set of fields in the format specified by the first field file format descriptor in the command name (i.e., BASIS, RGRID, or KGRID) and writes the same field to another file in the format specified by the second descriptor. Each of these commands takes two file names as parameters, the first of which is the name of the input file, and the second of which is the name of the output file. <br  />
</p>
<p>For example, a command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">BASIS_TO_RGRID   out/w.bf   out/w.rf</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> would read a file named "out/w.bf" that contains a set of fields in symmetry-adapted basis format, and writes a representation of the same field to a file named "w.rf" in r-grid format. As with all file names, relative file names are interpreted as names defined relative to the current working directory.</p>
<p>These file conversion function do not have any effect on the w and c fields that are stored in memory to represent the current state of the system of primary interest. All of the mathematical operations that these commands perform in order to convert from one format to the other are performed using private temporary arrays.</p>
<p>The r-grid and k-grid formats can be used to represent any real field, but the basis format can only represent fields that are symmetric under all symmetry elements of a specified space group. The name of the relevant space group specified both in the parameter file and in the header of the field file. The conversion from r-grid or k-grid formats to basis format are thus only valid if the field contained in the r-grid or k-grid input file actually has the assumed symmetry. The RGRID_TO_BASIS and KGRID_TO_BASIS output warnings if they finds that one or more fields in the input file are not symmetric to within some tolerance, but nonetheless attempt to complete the conversion. Applying either of these conversion functions to a field that does not have the specified space group symmetry is not a valid operation, however, and can modify the fields in unpredictable ways.</p>
<p>The conversion to a basis format from an r-grid or k-grid format is guaranteed to be safe if the declared space group is the trivial group that contains only the identity element (i.e., 1D group P_1, 2D plane group p_1, or 3D space group P_1), since this group does no imply any nontrivial symmetry constraints.</p>

Field File Analysis</h1>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_symmetry_sub"></a> The <b>CHECK_RGRID_SYMMETRY</b> command can be used to check whether a field that is represented in r-grid format has a specified space group symmetry to within a specified tolerance. The command takes the name of an input file and error tolerance epsilon as parameters. It reads the file with the specified name, checks if it is invariant under all space group operations to within the specified tolerance, and writes a report to the log file.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_compare_sub"></a> The <b>COMPARE_BASIS</b> and <b>COMPARE_RGRID</b> commands each read a pair of field files in the same format (basis or rgrid format, respectively), computes differences between corresponding fields, and write a report to the log file summarizing several measures of the magnitude of the differences.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_fieldmanip_sec"></a>
Field File Manipulations</h1>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_estimatewbasis_sub"></a><b> ESTIMATE_W_BASIS </b>: The ESTIMATE_W_BASIS command reads a set of approximate monomer volume fraction fields in symmetry-adapted basis format from the file whose name is passed as the first command parameter, and uses these to construct an estimate of the corresponding w fields, which is written to a file whose name is passed as the second command parameter. This is intended to allow users to construct an initial guess for w fields needed as an input to the ITERATE and SWEEP commands from an initial guess for the volume fraction fields for the structure of interest. The initial guess for the volume fraction fields does not need to be perfect, merely close enough to the final structure to allow a chosen iteration algorithm to converge.</p>
<p>The estimated w fields are computed by setting the Lagrange multiplier field to zero in the self-consistent field condition, giving an estimated w field    </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[   w_{\alpha}({\bf r}) =
   \sum_{\beta} \chi_{\alpha\beta}\phi_{\beta}({\bf r})
\]
</p>
<p> for monomer type \( \alpha \), in which \( \phi_{\beta} ({\bf r}) \) is the volume fraction of monomer type \( \beta \), as read from the input file, and \( \chi_{\alpha\beta} \) is a binary Flory-Huggins interaction parameter.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_scale_sub"></a> The <b>SCALE_BASIS</b> and <b>SCALE_RGRID</b> commands each read an field file (in basis or rgrid format, respectively), generates a field by multiplying all components or elements of the fields by a common scalar factor, and writes the resulting re-scaled fields to an output file. The field is multiplied by the value of the command argument "factor" to obtain the re-scaled field.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_expand_dim_sub"></a>The <b> EXPAND_RGRID_DIMENSION</b> command allows a user to take a field that was computed using a reduced dimensionality D=1 or D=2 and use it to create a field file output in a format appropriate to a higher dimension d, with D &lt; d &lt;= 3. For example, this command could be used to convert the result of a 1D SCFT calculation for a lamellar phase into a file format that could be read in as the initial field configuration for a 3D FTS simulation of a lamellar phase. To this, the command would be used within a command file for pscf_pc invoked with a command line option -d 1 (thus setting D=1) to read in the converged file for a lamellar phase, and with a command parameter d=3 in order to output a file in the format appropriate for a 3D calculation. In order to expand the number of dimensions, values of all fields are assumed to be independent of coordinates associated with the added dimensions. The parameter newGridDimensions is an integer array of dimension d-D in which element i contains the number of grid points along added direction D+i, for 0 &lt;= i &lt; d-D.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_replicate_sub"></a>The <b> REPLICATE_UNIT_CELL </b> command is instead designed to read in a field file containing one unit cell of a periodic structure and create a corresponding file in which that unit cell is replicated a specified number of times in each direction. This is useful because SCFT calculations are normally performed within a single unit cell, but it is often necessary to perform FTS calculations of ordered structures in simulation unit cells that contain several unit cells of the ordered structure in order to minimize finite size effects in calculations with fluctuating fields. Parameter replicas is an array of D integers in which element i contains the number of replicas of the original unit cell along direction i, for 0 &lt;= i &lt; D.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_external_sec"></a>
External fields</h1>
<p>The pscf_pc program accepts several commands that allow users to input and output external chemical potential fields that act on monomers of each type, in addition to the internally generated fields that arise in a self-consistent field approximation from interactions. External fields are referred to throughout the source code and documentation as "h" fields. This feature was introduced into the code to allow simulation of polymers in thin films or other confined geometries, for which external fields that act differently on different monomer types are used to represent selective interactions of polymers with the confining walls.</p>
<p>When nonzero external fields have been set, the self-consistent field equations become equations of the form     </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[   w_{\alpha}({\bf r})
   = \sum_{\beta} \chi_{\alpha\beta}\phi_{\beta}({\bf r})
   + \xi({\bf r}) + h_{\alpha}({\bf r})
\]
</p>
<p> for each monomer type \( \alpha \), in which \( h_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \) is the external field for monomers of type \( \alpha \), \( \xi ({\bf r}) \) is the Lagrange multiplier local pressure field that imposes incompressibility, and \( \chi_{\alpha\beta} \) is the binary Flory-Huggins interaction parameter for monomers of types \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \).</p>
<p>Simulations of polymer liquids confined to thin films may use external fields to represent interactions of different monomer types with the boundaries or "walls" of the film. The external fields that are used to define a thin film problem are defined algorithmically by the thin film ImposedFieldsGenerator, as described <a class="el" href="scft_thin_films_page.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The <b>READ_H_BASIS</b> and <b>READ_H_RGRID</b> commands can be used to instead read in external fields from an existing file and apply them to the current simulation. Files that contain external fields use the same formats as those used for w fields. Users who use a thin film ImposedFieldsGenerator to simulate a thin film generally do not need to read external fields from file, because they are instead defined by the generator.</p>
<p>The <b>WRITE_H_BASIS</b> and <b>WRITE_H_RGRID</b> commands write the current external fields, if any, to a specified field in basis or r-grid format.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_mask_sec"></a>
Mask field (inhomogeneous density constraint)</h1>
<p>A polymer fluid can be confined to a specified region by introducing a "mask" field that modifies the incompressibility constraint. A mask field is a dimensionless function of position, denoted here by \( m({\bf r}) \), that has a value very close to 1 throughout a region to which the polymer material is confined and a value very close to 0 throughout a region from which the material is being excluded. The incompressibility constraint for a system that is subjected to a mask is modified so as to require that   </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[   v \sum_{\alpha=1} c_\alpha({\bf r}) = m({\bf r})
\]
</p>
<p> at every point in the system, where \( m({\bf r}) \) is the mask field, \( c_{\alpha}({\bf r}) \) is the number concentration of monomers of type \( \alpha \) at point \( {\bf r} \), \( v \) is the monomer reference volume, and the summation is over all distinct monomer types. Introduction of a mask provides a simple way to impose geometric confinement within a program that is designed for periodic systems.</p>
<p>The mask that is used to confine a polymer to a thin film is generated algorithmically by the thin film ImposedFieldsGenerator, as described in more detail <a class="el" href="scft_thin_films_page.html">here</a>. <br  />
</p>
<p>The commands <a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_readmaskbasis_cmd"></a><b>READ_MASK_BASIS</b> or <a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_readmaskrgrid_cmd"></a><b>READ_MASK_RGRID</b> may instead be used to read a mask field from a file in basis or r-grid format. The file formats are identical to those which would be used for a w or c field file for a system with only one monomer type. These commands are generally not needed by users who use an ImposedFieldsGenerator to define a thin film problem, because the mask is constructed and updated internally by the generator.</p>
<p>The commands <a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writemaskbasis_cmd"></a><b>WRITE_MASK_BASIS</b> or <a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writemaskrgrid_cmd"></a><b>WRITE_MASK_RGRID</b> may instead be used to write any current mask field to a file in basis or r-grid format.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_timers_sec"></a>
Timer commands</h1>
<p>The WRITER_TIMERS and CLEAR_TIMERS commands are designed to output and manipulate time counters that keep track of how much time was spent on various operations during either a preceding SCFT or a preceding FTS. These commands are designed to work either with SCFT or FTS calculations, depending on what types of calculation have been enabled in the parameter file.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_writetimer_sub"></a><b>WRITE_TIMERS</b>: The WRITE_TIMERS command writes a report of the amounts of computational time spent on different operations since the main program was invoked, or since the last time the timers were cleared by invoking CLEAR_TIMERS. The resulting report is output both to the file whose name is given a parameter and to the log output (i.e., standard output). If the parameter file contains an Iterator block, and has thus enabled SCFT, this command will output information about times spent on various operations with the SCFT iterator. If the parameter file contains a BdSimulator or McSimulator block, and thus enables FTS, then the WRITE_TIMERS will output information about time spent in different operations with the FTS time step loop.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="scft_command_pc_cleartimer_sub"></a><b>CLEAR_TIMERS</b> The CLEAR_TIMERS command clears the state of all available timers, resetting values of all timer variables to zero.</p>
