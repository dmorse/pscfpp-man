</p>
<p >The build system for PSCF is based on unix makefiles. Individual programs or groups of programs may be compiled by invoking the "make" command with an appropriate target name, using the syntax </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make target</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> where "target" represents a target name such as "all-cpu" or "pspg".</p>
<p >The make utility may be invoked from either the pscfpp/src/ or pscfpp/bld/ directories, or from the pscfpp/ root directory, using a common set of main target names in all three cases. Invoking make from the pscfpp/ root with a target that causes compilation generally has the same effect as invoking it from the pscfpp/bld directory with the same target, and initiates out-of-source compilation that creates intermediate files in the pscfpp/bld/ directory tree. Invoking make from within the pscfpp/src/ directory will instead initiate an in-source compilation that creates intermediate files in the src/ directory, alongside the source files. Makefile targets that create executable scft programs all install the resulting executable files in the pscfpp/bin directory, no matter where the make command is invoked from.</p>
<p >On this page, we explain the most important makefile targets in more detail than was given in the <a class="el" href="install_overview_page.html">overview of instructions</a>. The following instructions assume that you have already made the required changes to environment variables and run the setup script before using make to compile.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_targets_main_sec"></a>
Compilation</h1>
<p >All of the makefile targets described below can be invoked either from the pscfpp/ or pscfpp/bld/ directory to perform out-of-source compilation, or from the src/ directory to perform in-source compilation.</p>
<h2>all: </h2>
<p >To compile all programs in the PSCF package, enter: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make all</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The behavior of this command depends on whether CUDA compilation has been enabled. If CUDA compilation is not enabled (which is the default behavior), the "make all" command only compiles CPU programs pscf_fd, pscf_pc1, pscf_pc2, and pscf_pc3. If CUDA compilation is enabled, it also compiles the GPU-enabled programs pscf_pg1, pscf_pg2, and pscf_pg3.</p>
<p >CUDA compilation can be enabled or disabled by using the -c option of the configure script, e.g., by entering "./configure -c1" to enable CUDA compilation, as discussed in more detail <a class="el" href="install_configure_page.html">here</a>. When CUDA compilation is disabled, "make all" is equivalent to "make all-cpu". When CUDA compilation is enabled, it is equivalent to calling "make all-cpu" followed by "make pspg".</p>
<h2>fd1d: </h2>
<p >The fd1d target builds the pscf_fd 1D finite difference program, and compiles only the source code files needed by this program. The only dependency of this program is the GSL library. To compile just the pscf_fd program, simply enter: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make fd1d</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> If entered before compiling any other code, this command will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile a large number *.cpp files in the util/, pscf/ and fd1d/ namespace-level subdirectories of the src/ directory.</li>
<li>Install corresponding object (*.o) and dependency (*.d) files in corresponding locations within the chosen build directory (i.e., in either the bld/ or src/ directory)</li>
<li>Create a static library (with file extension *.a) in each of these three namespace-level subdirectories of the build directory.</li>
<li>Install an executable file named pscf_fd in the pscfpp/bin directory.</li>
</ul>
<p >To recompile these programs after making any changes to configuration files (e.g., after enabling or disabling the debugging feature or changing compiler command line options), simply reissue the "make fd1d" command. The build system will detect if you have changed any of the relevant configuration files, and will recompile any file that might be effected by such changes.</p>
<h2>pspc: </h2>
<p >The pspc makefile target builds the pscf_pc1, pscf_pc2, and pscf_pc3 pseudo-spectral programs for periodic microstructures on a CPU, and compiles all the source code files used by these programs. These programs depend on both the GSL library and the FFTW fast Fourier transform libraries. To compile these programs, enter: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make pspc</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the pscfpp/, pscfpp/bld or pscfpp/src directory. This command will cause the system to:</p>
<ul>
<li>As needed, compile all *.cpp files in the src/util/ and src/pscf/ directories that have not been previously compiled, and, if necessary, create associated static library files in these directories.</li>
<li>Compile all of the *.cpp files in the src/pspc/ directory, and create create a corresponding static library file there.</li>
<li>Install executable program file named pscf_pc1, pscf_pc2, and pscf_pc3 in the pscfpp/bin directory.</li>
</ul>
<p >The three resulting three programs are used for problems structures that are periodic in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, respectively. One would thus use pscf_pc1 to simulate a lamellar (one-dimensional) structure, pscf_pc2 to simulate a hexagonal cylinder (two-dimension structure), or pscf_pc3 to simulate a fully three-dimensional structure such a BCC or gyroid structure.</p>
<h2>all-cpu: </h2>
<p >To compile and build all CPU-based programs, but not any GPU-enable programs, enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make all-cpu</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This is equivalent to entering "make fd1d" followed by "make pspc".</p>
<h2>pspg: </h2>
<p >The pspg makefile target compiles the pscf_pg1, pscf_pg2, and pscf_pg3 GPU-enabled pseudo-spectral programs for periodic microstructures. To compile these programs on a computer with an appropriate NVIDIA GPU and the NVCC Cuda compiler, enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make pspg</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from either the pscfpp root directory or the desired build directory. If successful, this will compile code from the pspg/ subdirectory of the src/ directory, place object, dependency and library files in subdirectories of the chosen build tree, and install executables for 1, 2, and 3 dimensional problems named pscf_pg1, pscf_pg2 and pscf_pg3 in the pscfpp/bin directory.</p>
<p >This target does not check whether CUDA compilation has been enabled (by defining PSCF_CUDA), will fail if invoked on a machine that does not support CUDA compilation.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_targets_docs_sec"></a>
Documentation</h1>
<p >To create a local copy of the html files for this web manual, enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make html</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from either the pscfpp/ or pscfpp/docs directory. This procedure requires that doxygen be installed, and is discussed greater detail on the <a class="el" href="install_doc_page.html">following page</a>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_targets_clean_sec"></a>
Clean-up</h1>
<p >The following targets remove files in order to clean up after compilation, rather than creating files.</p>
<h2>clean: </h2>
<p >If, for any reason, you would like to clean up after compiling by removing all of the object, dependency and library files that are generated during compilation, you may enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make clean</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from either the chosen build directory or from the pscfpp/ root directory. The clean target removes all the intermediate files generated by compilation, but does not remove the final executable files or the configuration files that were created by the setup command. If "make clean" is invoked from the pscfpp/ root directory, it removes all such intermediate files in both the bld/ and src/ directory. If "make clean" is invoked from the src/ or bld/ directory, it only removes such files from the directory from which it is invoked.</p>
<p >The "make clean" command can also be invoked from almost any subdirectory of the src/ directory tree in order to remove recursively remove intermediate files from that directory and its subdirectories. The "make clean" command can also be invoked from namespace level subdirectories of the bld/ directory, with the same effect.</p>
<h2>clean-bin: </h2>
<p >The "clean-bin" command removes all of the pscf executable files named pscf_* that are created by compilation and normally installed in the pscfpp/bin directory. It does not remove other executable scripts that are installed in the bin/ directory by the setup script.</p>
<h2>clean-docs: </h2>
<p >The "clean-docs" command removes any files that have been generated in the docs/ directory by the doxygen documentation generation utility, including all of the html files that are created in the docs/html directory.</p>
<h2>veryclean: </h2>
<p >The "make clean" and "make clean-bin" commands discussed above remove files that are generated by compilation, but do not remove the various files that are installed by the setup script, which include various makefile fragments and C++ files. To remove these files in addition to all of those removed by the "clean", "clean-bin" and "clean-docs" targets, enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make veryclean</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the pscfpp/ root directory. This command returns the pscfpp/ directory tree to a state very similar to the state it had immediately after the repository was created by cloning a remote repository.</p>
<p >After you run "make veryclean", you will need to rerun the setup script before attempting to compile any code.</p>
<p >The "veryclean" target erases almost all of the files that are generated by the setup script, compilation, and the documentation generator. There are, however, a few types of files that do not exist in the repository but that it will not erase. Specifically, it will not erase any local compiler setup files files that the user may have created in the make/compiler directory. After invoking "make veryclean", a user can thus invoke setup with the name of a previously created compiler setup file as an argument in order to recreate a similar initial configuration.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_targets_makeall_sec"></a>
Invoking make from within src/</h1>
<p >When compiling in-source, by invoking make from within the src/ directory tree, users may also invoke "make all" from a subdirectory of src/ in order to compile a smaller set of source files. Invoking the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">make all</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from almost any subdirectory of the src/ directory tree will compile all C++ files in the tree rooted at that subdirectory, without compiling any code outside of that subdirectory.</p>
<p >Invoking "make all" from a subdirectory of a namespace level directory (i.e., a subdirectory of the src/util, src/pscf, src/fd1d, src/pspc, or src/pspg directory) will generally compile all the *.cpp and *.cu source files in that directory and any nested subdirectories.</p>
<p >Invoking "make all" from any namespace level subdirectory of src/ will not only compile of all the *.cpp and *.cu source files in the namespace level directory tree, but will also create a static library file containing all of the resulting object code, and then build and install executables for any programs for which the source files are in that directory. For example, entering "make all" from src/fd1d directory will create a static library named src/fd1d/libfd1d.a, and install an executable named pscf_fd in the bin/ directory.</p>
<p ><em> Rationale </em>: The ability to invoke "make all" from any subdirectory of src/ is designed to allow developers to use the command line to easily recompile a few files from rom within the directory in which they are working. Typically, when a developer is adding a new feature or fixing a bug, he or she will be usually be actively editing only a few files within a single subdirectory of the src/ directory. Other files in the same subdirectory will usually be left untouched during this process. The system for keeping track of dependencies used by the PSCF build system guarantees that invoking "make all" from the directory containing the the files of immediate interest will only recompile source files that have recently been modified, that include header files that have recently been modified, or that have not already been compiled. A common work flow during development for those who work from a command line is thus to edit a file, exit the editor, then invoke "make all" from the directory containing that file to check if the modified file compiles.</p>
<p ><em> Comment </em>: Invoking make with the name of a single file as a target (e.g., with the name of a *.o object file) generally does <em>not</em> work as intended, unless one uses the absolute path to the file. The reason for this is that patterns and dependency files used by the pscf makefile system all use absolute paths. The build system thus may not recognize a relative path to a file as equivalent to the absolute paths used in the files that define makefile patterns and dependencies among files. Consistent use of "make all" for in-source compilation avoids this limitation, because "make all" causes the "make" utility to try to compile a list of source files whose locations are provided internally as absolute paths.</p>
