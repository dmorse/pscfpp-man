<p >The build system for PSCF is based on unix makefiles. Individual programs or groups of programs may be compiled by invoking the "make" command with an appropriate target name, using the syntax </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make target</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> where "target" represents a target name such as "all-cpu" or "pspg".</p>
<p >The make utility may be invoked from either the pscfpp/src/ or pscfpp/bld/ directories, or from the pscfpp/ root directory, using a common set of main target names in all three cases. Invoking make from the pscfpp/ root with a target that causes compilation generally has the same effect as invoking it from the pscfpp/bld directory with the same target, and initiates out-of-source compilation that creates intermediate files in the pscfpp/bld/ directory tree. Invoking make from within the pscfpp/src/ directory will instead initiate an in-source compilation that creates intermediate files in the src/ directory, alongside the source files. Makefile targets that create executable scft programs all install the resulting executable files in the pscfpp/bin directory, no matter where the make command is invoked from.</p>
<p >On this page, we explain the most important makefile targets in more detail than was given in the <a class="el" href="install_overview_page.html">overview of instructions</a>. The following instructions assume that you have already made the required changes to environment variables and run the setup script before using make to compile.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_targets_main_sec"></a>
Compilation</h1>
<p >All of the makefile targets described below can be invoked either from the pscfpp/ or pscfpp/bld/ directory to perform out-of-source compilation, or from the src/ directory to perform in-source compilation.</p>
<h2>fd1d: </h2>
<p >The fd1d target compiles the pscf_fd 1D finite difference program. <br  />
 The only dependency of this program is the GSL library. To compile just this program, simply enter: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make fd1d</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> If entered before compiling any other code, this command will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile a large number *.cpp files in the util/, pscf/ and fd1d/ namespace-level subdirectories of the src/ directory.</li>
<li>Install corresponding object (*.o) and dependency (*.d) files in corresponding locations within the chosen build directory (i.e., in either the bld/ or src/ directory)</li>
<li>Create a static library (with file extension *.a) in each of these three namespace-level subdirectories of the build directory.</li>
<li>Install an executable file named pscf_fd in the pscfpp/bin directory.</li>
</ul>
<p >To recompile these programs after making any changes to configuration files (e.g., after enabling or disabling the debugging feature or changing compiler command line options), simply reissue the "make fd1d" command. The build system will detect if you have changed any of the relevant configuration files, and will recompile any file that might be effected by such changes.</p>
<h2>pspc: </h2>
<p >The pspc makefile target compiles the pscf_pc1, pscf_pc2, and pscf_pc3 pseudo-spectral programs for periodic microstructures on a CPU. These programs depend on both the GSL library and the FFTW fast Fourier transform libraries. To compile these programs, enter: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make pspc</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the pscfpp/, pscfpp/bld or pscfpp/src directory. This command will cause the system to:</p>
<ul>
<li>As needed, compile all *.cpp files in the src/util/ and src/pscf/ directories that have not been previously compiled, and, if necessary, create associated static library files in these directories.</li>
<li>Compile all of the *.cpp files in the src/pspc/ directory, and create create a corresponding static library file there.</li>
<li>Install executable program file named pscf_pc1, pscf_pc2, and pscf_pc3 in the pscfpp/bin directory.</li>
</ul>
<p >The three resulting three programs are used for problems structures that are periodic in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, respectively. One would thus use pscf_pc1 to simulate a lamellar (one-dimensional) structure, pscf_pc2 to simulate a hexagonal cylinder (two-dimension structure), or pscf_pc3 to simulate a fully three-dimensional structure such a BCC or gyroid structure.</p>
<h2>all-cpu: </h2>
<p >To compile all CPU-based programs, but not any GPU-enable programs, enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make all-cpu</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This is equivalent to entering "make fd1d" followed by "make pspc".</p>
<h2>pspg: </h2>
<p >The pspg makefile target compiles the pscf_pg1, pscf_pg2, and pscf_pg3 GPU-enabled pseudo-spectral programs for periodic microstructures. To compile these programs on a computer with an appropriate NVIDIA GPU and the NVCC Cuda compiler, enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make pspg</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from either the pscfpp root directory or the desired build directory. If successful, this will compile code from the pspg/ subdirectory of the src/ directory, place object, dependency and library files in subdirectories of the chosen build tree, and install executables for 1, 2, and 3 dimensional problems named pscf_pg1, pscf_pg2 and pscf_pg3 in the pscfpp/bin directory.</p>
<h2>all: </h2>
<p >To compile all CPU and GPU programs on a computer that supports compilation of CUDA as well as C++, enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make all</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> This will fail if invoked on a machine that does not support compilation of CUDA code.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_targets_clean_sec"></a>
Clean-up</h1>
<p >The following targets remove files in order to clean up after compilation, rather than creating files.</p>
<h2>clean: </h2>
<p >If, for any reason, you would like to clean up after compiling by removing all of the object, dependency and library files that are generated during compilation, you may enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make clean</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from either the chosen build directory or from the pscfpp/ root directory. The clean target removes all files generated by compilation, but not the configuration files that were created by the setup command. <br  />
 If "make clean" is invoked from the pscfpp/ root directory, it removes all such intermediate files in both the bld/ and src/ directory. If "make clean" is invoked from the src/ or bld/ directory, it only removes such files from the directory from which it is invoked.</p>
<p >The "make clean" command can also be invoked from almost any subdirectory of the src/ directory tree in order to remove recursively remove intermediate files from that directory and its subdirectories. The "make clean" command can also be invoked from namespace level subdirectories of the bld/ directory, with the same effect.</p>
<h2>veryclean: </h2>
<p >The "make clean" command discussed above removes files that are generated by compilation, but does not remove the various makefile fragments and C++ files that are installed prior to compilation by the "setup" script. To remove these files as well, instead enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make veryclean</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from the pscfpp/ root directory. This command returns the pscfpp/ directory tree to a state as close as possible to its state immediately after the repository was cloned.</p>
<p >Because the "make veryclean" command removes files that are created by the setup script, you will need to rerun the setup script after entering "make veryclean" before attempting to compile any code.</p>
<p >The "veryclean" target does not erase any local compiler configuration files that the user may have created in the make/compiler directory. After invoking "make veryclean", a user can thus invoke setup with the name of a previously created compiler configuration file as an argument in order to recreate the same configuration.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_targets_makeall_sec"></a>
Invoking make from within src/</h1>
<p >When compiling in-source, by invoking make from within the src/ directory tree, users may also invoke "make all" from a subdirectory of src/ in order to compile a smaller set of source files. Invoking the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make all</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> from almost any subdirectory of the src/ directory tree will compile all C++ files in the tree rooted at that subdirectory, without compiling any code outside of that subdirectory.</p>
<p >Invoking "make all" from any namespace level subdirectory of src/ (i.e., from the src/util, src/pscf, src/fd1d, src/pspc, or src/pspg directory) will not only cause compilation of all the *.cpp and *.cu source files in the namespace level directory tree, and will also create a static library file containing all of the resulting object code, and then install executables for any programs for which the source files are in that directory. For example, entering "make all" from src/fd1d directory will create a static library named src/fd1d/libfd1d.a, and install an executable named pscf_fd in the bin/ directory.</p>
<p >Invoking "make all" from a subdirectory of a namespace level directory will generally compile all the source files in that directory and its subdirectories, but will not create any library or executable files.</p>
<p >The ability to invoke "make all" from any subdirectory of src/ is designed to allow developers to use the command line to easily recompile a few files from rom within the directory in which they are working. Typically, when a developer is adding a new feature or fixing a bug, he or she will be actively editing only a few files within a single subdirectory of the src/ directory, while other files in that subdirectory are left untouched. Under these circumstances, if all files other than the ones that were recently modified have already been compiled, invoking "make all" from the directory containing the the files of immediate interest will only recompile source files that have recently been modified or that include header files that have recently been modified. A common work flow during development is thus to edit a file, then invoke "make all" from the directory containing that file to check if the modified file compiles.</p>
<p >Invoking make with the name of a desired file as a target (e.g., with the name of a *.o object file) generally does <em>not</em> work as intended, unless one uses the absolute path to the file. The reason for this is that patterns and dependency files used by the pscf makefile system all use absolute paths. The build system thus may not recognize a relative path to a file as equivalent to the absolute paths used in the files that define makefile patterns and dependencies among files. Consistent use of "make all" for compilation gets around this limitation.</p>
