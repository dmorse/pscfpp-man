</p>
<p>The main makefile in the bld/ or src/ directory may be used to compile individual programs or groups of closely related programs. On this page, we explain the most important makefile targets in more detail than was given in the <a class="el" href="install_overview_page.html">overview of instructions</a>. The following instructions assume that you have already made the required changes to environment variables and run the setup script before invoking make.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_targets_main_sec"></a>
Main makefile targets</h1>
<p>All of the makefile targets described below can be invoked either from the bld/ directory to perform out-of-source compilation, or from the src/ directory to perform in-source compilation.</p>
<h2>fd1d: </h2>
<p>The fd1d target compiles the pscf_fd 1D finite difference program. The only dependency of this program is the GSL library. To compile just this program, simply cd to the root of the desired build directory (i.e., to pscfpp/bld or pscfpp/src) and enter: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make fd1d</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> If entered before compiling any other code, this command will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile a large number *.cpp files in the util/, pscf/ and fd1d/ namespace-level subdirectories of the src/ directory.</li>
<li>Install corresponding object (*.o) and dependency (*.d) files in corresponding locations within the chosen build directory (i.e., the build or bld/ or src/ directory)</li>
<li>Create a static library (with file extension *.a) in each of these three namespace-level subdirectories of the build directory.</li>
<li>Install an executable file named pscf_fd in the pscfpp/bin directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>To recompile these programs after making any changes to configuration files (e.g., after enabling or disabling the debugging feature or changing compiler command line options), simply reissue the "make fd1d" command. The build system will detect if you have changed any of the relevant configuration files, and will recompile any file that might be effected by such changes.</p>
<h2>pspc: </h2>
<p>The pspc makefile target compiles the pscf_pc1d, pscf_pc2d, and pscf_ps3d pseudo-spectral programs for periodic microstructures on a CPU. These programs depend on both the GSL library and the FFTW fast Fourier transform libraries. To compile these programs cd to the chosen build directory (bld/ or src/) and enter: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make pspc</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> If this is done after compiling pscf_fd, this will compile some additional files in the src/pspc directory, and will install three executable files named pscf_pc1d, pscf_pc2d and pscf_pc3d in the pscfpp/bin directory. These three programs are used for problems structures that are periodic in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions, respectively. One would thus use pscf_pc1d to simulate a lamellar (one-dimensional) structure, pscf_pc2d to simulate a hexagonal cylinder (two-dimension structure), an pscf_pc3d to simulate a fully three-dimensional structure such a BCC or gyroid structure.</p>
<h2>cpu-all: </h2>
<p>The cpu-all target compiles all CPU-based programs, i.e., the finite difference 1D program and the CPU based programs for periodic structures.</p>
<h2>pspg: </h2>
<p>The pspc makefile target compiles the pscf_pg1d, pscf_pg2d, and pscf_pg3d GPU-enabled pseudo-spectral programs for periodic microstructures. To compile these programs on a computer with a Cuda compiler, enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make pspg</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> from the desired build directory. If successful, this will compile code from the util/, pscf/, and pspg/ subdirectories of the src/ directory, place object, dependency and library files in the build directory tree, and install executables for 1, 2, and 3 dimensional problems named pscf_pg1d, pscf_pg2d and pscf_pg3d in the pscfpp/bin directory.</p>
<h2>all: </h2>
<p>The all target attempts to compile all CPU and GPU programs. It will fail if invoked on a machine that does not support compilation of CUDA programs.</p>
<h2>clean: </h2>
<p>If, for any reason, you would like to clean up after compiling by removing all of the object, dependency and library files that are generated during compilation, you may enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make clean</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> from either the chosen build directory or from the pscfpp/ root directory. The clean target removes all files generated by compilation, but not the configuration files that were created by the setup command. If "make clean" is invoked from the pscfpp/ root directory, it removes all such intermediate files in both the bld/ and src/ directory. If "make clean" is invoked from the src/ or bld/ directory, it only removes such files from the directory from which it is invoked.</p>
<p>The "make clean" command can also be invoked from almost any subdirectory of the src/ directory tree in order to remove recursively remove intermediate files from that directory and its subdirectories. The "make clean" command can also be invoked from namespace level subdirectories of the bld/ directory, with the same effect, but not from lower level subdirectories of the bld/ tree, because lower level subdirectories of bld/ do not contain makefiles.</p>
<h2>veryclean: </h2>
<p>The "make clean" command discussed above removes files that are generated by compilation, but does not remove the various makefile fragments and C++ files that are installed prior to compilation by the "setup" script. To remove these files as well, instead enter </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make veryclean</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> from the pscfpp/ root directory. This command returns the pscfpp/ directory tree to a state very close to its state immediately after the repository was cloned.</p>
<p>Because the "make veryclean" command removes files that are created by the setup script, you will need to rerun the setup script after "make veryclean" before attempting to compile any code.</p>
<p>The "veryclean" target does not erase any local compiler setup files that the user may have created in the make/compiler directory. After invoking "make veryclean", a user can thus invoke setup with the name of a previously created compiler configuration file as an argument in order to recreate the same configuration.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="install_targets_makeall_sec"></a>
Invoking "make all" from a subdirectory</h1>
<p>When compiling in-source, from within the src/ directory tree, users may also invoke make from a subdirectory of src/ in order to compile a smaller set of source files. Invoking the command </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt; make all</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> from almost any subdirectory of the src/ directory tree will compile all C++ files in the tree rooted at that subdirectory, while not compiling any code outside of that subdirectory.</p>
<p>Invoking "make all" from any namespace level subdirectory of src/ (i.e., from the src/util, src/simp, src/mcMd, src/ddMd or src/mdPp directory) will cause make to compile all the *.cpp source files in the namespace level directory tree, and will also create a library containing all of the resulting object code, and compile and install any main programs for which the source files are in that directory.</p>
<p>The ability to invoke "make all" from any subdirectory of src/ is designed to allow developers to easily recompile a few files from the command line from within the directory in which they are working. Typically, when a developer is adding a new feature or fixing a bug, he or she will be actively editing only a few files within one subdirectory of the source directory, while other files in that subdirectory are left untouched. Under these circumstances, if all files other than the ones that were recently modified have already been compiled, invoking "make all" from the directory containing the files of interest will only recompile source files that have recently been modified or that include header files that have recently been modified. A common work flow during development is thus to edit a file, then invoke "make all" from the directory containing that file.</p>
