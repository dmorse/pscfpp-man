</p>
<p>After the configure script has been run, the src and bld directory will each contain a file named config.mk. These are system configuration files that that are included by other makefiles. These files assign values to a variety of makefile variables that are used throughout the build system. Default versions of these two build configuration files are installed by the configure script, but the variable definitions given in these files may be modified by users as needed.</p>
<p>The config.mk configuration file in each build directory (i.e., in the src or bld directory) is included in every other makefile in the same build directory tree. The config.mk file in the src directory is thus included by all makefiles in the src directory tree, but not those in the bld directory. As a result, the contents of the src/config.mk file only affects in-source builds that are performed by calling make from within the src directory. Conversely, the config.mk file in the bld directory is included by all makefiles in the bld directory tree, but not those in the src directory, and so only affects out-of-source builds.</p>
<p>Most of the variables defined in the src/config.mk and bld/config.mk files fall into one of the following three categories, each of which is discussed in more detail below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="#developer_build_config_dirvars_sec">Directory path variables</a> : The variables ROOT_DIR, SRC_DIR, BLD_DIR, and BIN_DIR give absolute paths to the PSCF root directory and several of its subdirectories.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="#developer_build_config_features_sec">Variables that enable optional features</a> : The variables UITL_DEBUG and PSCF_CUDA control whether or not particular optional features are enabled when PSCF is compiled.</li>
<li><a class="el" href="#developer_build_config_rules_sec">Variables used in makefile rules</a> : A variety of variables such as CXX, CPP_FLAGS, CXX_FLAGS, LD_FLAGS are used in the pattern rules for compilation of individual source files and in rules for creation of libraries and executable files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The config.mk files contain extensive comments that explain the meaning and usage of most of the variables that are defined in those files. Users who are interested in understanding details of how the build system works should thus skim the notes given in either of these config.mk files, in addition to reading the relevant parts of this web manual.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_config_dirvars_sec"></a>
Directory path variables</h1>
<p>Among the makefile variables defined in the config.mk file in each build directory are several variables whose values give paths to the PSCF root directory and several of its subdirectories. The names and meanings of the most important such path variables are listed below: </p><table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Name </th><th>Meaning </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>ROOT_DIR </td><td>Path to PSCF root directory </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>SRC_DIR </td><td>Path to the source directory </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>BLD_DIR </td><td>Path to the build directory </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>BIN_DIR </td><td>Path to directory for installing executables </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The values assigned to all of these variables are absolute paths. On any unix-like system, the first character of an absolute path is a backslash ("/") character that represents the root of the computer filesystem. The value of the ROOT_DIR variable is set by the configure script to be the absolute path to the root directory as of the time that the configure script was run. Values of other variables are using knowldedge of ROOT_DIR, as discussed below.</p>
<p>The config.mk files that are created by the configure script in the src and bld directories are identical except for the value of the variable BLD_DIR, which gives the path to the build directory in which intermediate files will be placed. In each of these configuration files, BLD_DIR is assigned a value is which the absolute path to directory that contains the configuration file, i.e., the absolute path of the bld directory in the file bld/config.mk file or the absolute path of the src directory within the file src/config.mk. In other parts of the build system, the value $(BLD_DIR) is used as a prefix to construct absolute paths for all intermediate file targets. The use of different values for BLD_DIR in these two files thus allows the system to perform in-source builds when make is invoked from within the src directory and out-of-source builds when make is invoked from within the bld directory.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose that a user with user name smith has a home directory /users/smith, and suppose that this user has installed the PSCF root directory as a subdirectory of their home directory, as /users/smith/pscfpp. In this case, the relevant part of the config.mk in the bld directory file would look like this after the configure script has been run: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">ROOT_DIR=/users/smith/<a class="code hl_namespace" href="namespacepscfpp.html">pscfpp</a></div>
<div class="line">SRC_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/src</div>
<div class="line">BLD_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/bld</div>
<div class="line">BIN_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/bin</div>
<div class="ttc" id="anamespacepscfpp_html"><div class="ttname"><a href="namespacepscfpp.html">pscfpp</a></div><div class="ttdoc">Python package of all python modules provided with PSCF.</div><div class="ttdef"><b>Definition</b> <a href="____init_____8py_source.html#l00001">__init__.py:1</a></div></div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> The symbol $(ROOT_DIR) represents the value of the makefile variable ROOT_DIR, which is given here by /usrs/smith/pscfpp. The config.mk file in the bld directory is only included by makefiles in the bld directory, and is only used during an out-of-source build. This file file thus declares $(ROOT_DIR)/bld to be the build directory in which all intermediate files should be placed.</p>
<p>The corresponding variable definitions in the config.mk file in the src directory in this example would be almost identical to those shown above, <em>except</em> for the value assigned to the variable BLD_DIR: In the file src/config.mk, BLD_DIR would be assigned a value </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">BLD_DIR=$(ROOT_DIR)/src</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> rather than $(ROOT_DIR)/bld. The config.mk file in the src directory is used only for in-source compilation, and so it declares that the src directory should be used as the build directory.</p>
<p>The main executable files named pscf_1d, pscf_pc, and pscf_pg are created within the BIN_DIR. Users can, if desired, change the location in which these files are created by using a text editor to change the value assigned to BIN_DIR within either or both of the config.mk files. The executable files produced by PSCF are self-contained and moveable, however, and so these files may also simply be moved to a new location after they are created.</p>
<p>The value of the variable ROOT_DIR is set by the configure script. To do so, the script uses shell commands to identify the absolute path of the directory that contains the configure script, which is located in the root directory of the PSCF repository. If the PSCF root directory is moved or renamed after the configure script has been run, users will need to rerun the configure script to reset the value of this variable, and then rebuild the package. Recompilation is necessary if the PSCF root directory is moved because some executables contain hard-coded paths to data files that are located in within the PSCF directory tree. Specifically, the pscf_pc and pscf_pg executables access files in the data subdirectory of the PSCF root directory, and the absolute path to this data directory is set by the configure script by modifying a C++ header file named <a class="el" href="paths_8h.html" title="File containing absolute paths to data, for use in code and tests.">src/pscf/paths.h</a> that is included by other C++ files.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_config_features_sec"></a>
Variables that enable optional features</h1>
<p>The variables UTIL_DEBUG and PSCF_CUDA are each used to control whether a specific feature is enabled or disabled when PSCF is compiled. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining UTIL_DEBUG enables a set of optional run-time checks that are useful for finding or analyzing errors, at a slight cost in execution speed. <br  />
</li>
<li>Defining PSCF_CUDA enables compilation of code that uses an NVIDIA GPU, and creation of the pscf_pg executable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The config.mk code contains two statements that can each be used to define one of these variables, in order to enable the associated feature, or that can be commented out in order disable the associated feature. The lines that define these two variables are commented out by default, by placing a point (#) symbol at the beginning of each line, so both of these features are disabled by default. For example, in the default state of either of the config.mk files created by the configure script, the line that defines UTIL_DEBUG looks like </p><pre class="fragment">#UTIL_DEBUG = 1
</pre><p> Either feature may enabled by removing the # symbol at the beginning of the relevant line, to enable the definition of the corresponding makefile variable. Both of these variables are assigned default values of 1, but the value is irrelevant - the behavior of the makefile system only depends on whether these variables are defined or not, and does not depend on the value assigned to either.</p>
<p>The debugging and CUDA features of PSCF may also be enabled or disabled by using the -d or -c options of the setopts script, respectively. The setopts script actually functions by using a stream editor to uncomment or comment out the relevant line or lines of the appropriate config.mk file. Invoking the setopts script in the scr directory modifies the file src/config.mk, while invoking the corresponding script in the bld directory modifies the file bld/config.mk.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_config_rules_sec"></a>
Variables used in makefile rules</h1>
<p>A variety of other makefiles variables defined in the config.mk file are designed to be used in different types of makefile rules that provide instructions for compiling source files to create object files, creating static libraries, and creating executable files. The names and purposes of all such variables are described in comments within each config.mk file, as well as in the discussion in subsequent manual pages of various types of makefile rules that are defined in <a class="el" href="developer_build_pattern_page.html">pattern rule files</a>, <a class="el" href="developer_build_source_page.html">source list files</a>, or <a class="el" href="developer_build_makefile_page.html">makefiles</a>.</p>
