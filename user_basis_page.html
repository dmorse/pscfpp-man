<p >PSCF allows users to input and output chemical potential and monomer concentration fields using an expansion in basis functions in which each basis function is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian that is invariant under all symmetry operations of a specified space group. We refer to the resulting basis as a symmetry-adapted Fourier basis, and the expansion as a symmetry-adapated Fourier series. This page discusses the mathematics underlying the construction of such a basis.</p>
<p >Computations in the PSCF programs for periodic systems are performed using periodic fields defined on a regular grid, with Fourier transforms defined using a discrete Fourier transform. For simplicity, discussion given here uses notation appropriate to functions that are defined in a continuum. Everything presented here applies equally well to functions defined on a grid, however, with the understanding that values of such functions are only defined for positions that lie on nodes of the grid, and that wavevectors that are aliases of one another should be understood to be equivalent.</p>

Transformation and Symmetry of Fields</h1>
<p ><b> Definition (Field) </b>: We refer to any complex-valued periodic function of D-dimensional position within a crystal as a <em> field </em>. A real field has real values at any position.</p>
<p ><b> Notation (Transformation of Fields) </b>: If \( f \) is a field and \( A \) is a space group operation, then the notation  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
    f&#39; = fA

</p>
<p> indicates that \( f&#39; \) is a field for which  </p><p class="formulaDsp">

</p>
<p> for all \( {\bf r} \).</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_basis_symmfunc_def"></a><b> Definition (Symmetric Fields) </b>: A field \( f({\bf r}) \) is said to be symmetric or invariant under a space group \( S \) if \( fA = f \) or (equivalently)  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   f(A({\bf r})) = f({\bf r})

</p>
<p> for every space group operation \( A \in S \).</p>
<p >The following two simple theorems apply to symmetric functions:</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_basis_symmfunc_mult_thrm"></a><b> Theorem 1 (Symmetry is Preserved by Scalar Multiplication)</b>: If \( f({\bf r}) \) is a field that is symmetric under a space group \( S \), and \( c \) is complex constant, then \( cf({\bf r}) \) is also symmetric under \( S \).</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_basis_symmfunc_conj_thrm"></a><b> Theorem 2 (Symmetry is Preserved by Complex Conjugation)</b>: If \( f({\bf r}) \) is a complex field that is symmetric under a space group \( S \), its complex conjugate \( f^{*}({\bf r}) \) is also invariant under \( S \).

<p ><em>Proofs</em> : Suppose \( A = (R, {\bf t}) \) be a symmetry operation in \( S \). If \( f(R{\bf r} + {\bf t}) = f({\bf r})\) for all \( {\bf r} \), then \( c f(R{\bf r} + {\bf t}) = c f({\bf r}) \) and \( f^{*}(R{\bf r} + {\bf t}) = f^{*}({\bf r}) \), proving both of the above theorems.</p>

Transformation of Plane Waves</h1>
<p >To construct basis functions, we consider the effect of space group operations on a field that is expressed as a general Fourier series. As a first step, it useful to consider the effect of a symmetry operation on a single complex-exponential wave. The following definition and notation are used to simplify the discussion:</p>
<p ><b> Definition (Wave) </b>: A wave or plane wave \( f \) is a complex field of the form  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   f({\bf r}) = ce^{i{\bf G}\cdot{\bf r}}
\]
</p>
<p> in which \( c \) is a constant prefactor and \( {\bf G} \) is a wavevector. A wave has the periodicity of a specified Bravais lattice if and only if \( {\bf G} \) is in the associated reciprocal lattice.</p>
<p ><b> Notation (Wave) </b>: A wave \( f \) can be described compactly as a pair  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   f = ({\bf G}, c)
\]
</p>
<p> in which \( {\bf G} \) denotes the associated wavevector and \( c \) is the prefactor.</p>
<p ><b> Theorem 3 (Transformation of Waves) </b>: If \( f = ({\bf G}, c) \) is a wave and \( A=(R,{\bf t}) \) is a space group operation, then \( fA \) is a wave  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   fA = ({\bf G}&#39;, c&#39;)
\]
</p>
<p> with a modified wavevector  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   {\bf G}&#39; = R^{T}{\bf G}
\]
</p>
<p> and a modified prefactor  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   c&#39; =  c e^{i{\bf G} \cdot {\bf t}}  \quad.
\]
</p>
<p> Comment: Recall the <a class="el" href="user_symmetry_page.html#user_symmetry_adjoint_def_eqn">definition</a> of the adjoint of a point group operator \( R \) and the <a class="el" href="user_symmetry_page.html#user_symmetry_adjoint_matrix_sub">discussion</a> of the matrix representation used to compute the effect of such an adjoint operator on a wavevector.</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: The field \( f(A({\bf r})) \) that is obtained by applying operation \( A = (R, {\bf t}) \) to the argument \( {\bf r} \) of a field \( f({\bf r}) = c e^{i {\bf G}\cdot {\bf r}} \) is  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   f(A({\bf r}))
   =  c e^{i{\bf G} \cdot (R{\bf r} + {\bf t}) }
   =  c e^ {i {\bf G}\cdot {\bf t} } e^{ i{\bf G} \cdot R{\bf r} }
   \quad.
\]
</p>
<p> By using the fact that  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   {\bf G}\cdot (R{\bf r}) \equiv (R^{T}{\bf G})\cdot {\bf r}
\]
</p>
<p> we may rewrite this function as a plane wave  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   f(A({\bf r}))

\]
</p>
<p> with values of \( {\bf G}&#39; \) and \( c&#39; \) given in the theorem statement.</p>
<p >It is straightforward to confirm that this transformation of waves is invertible: If \( f&#39; = fA \) then \( f = f&#39;A^{-1} \). Two waves that are related in this way can be said to related by the symmetry operation \( A \), or by \( A^{-1} \).</p>
<p ><b> Notation (Transformation of Wavevectors) </b>: If \( {\bf G} \) is a wavevector and \( A= (R, {\bf t}) \) is a space group symmetry operation, then we define \( {\bf G}A \) to be the wavevector of a wave that is obtained by applying symmetry operation \( A \) to a wave with wavevector \( {\bf G} \), giving  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
  {\bf G}A \equiv R^{T}{\bf G} \quad.
\]
</p>
<p> It is straightforward to show that, for two wavevectors \( {\bf G} \) and \( {\bf G}&#39; \) and a symmetry operation \( A \), the equations \( {\bf G}&#39; = {\bf G}A \) and \( {\bf G} = {\bf G}&#39;A^{-1} \) are equivalent. Two wavevectors that are related by in this way can said to be related by symmetry operation \( A \) or \( A^{-1} \).</p>
<p >Observe that the notation defined above, which the operator appears to the right of the wavevector on which it acts, allows use to treat application of symmetry operators to wavevectors as an associative operation. That is, if \( A = (R_{A}, {\bf t}_{A} )\) and \( B=(R_{B}, {\bf t}_{B} ) \) are space group operations and \( {\bf G} \) is a wavevector, then  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[
   ({\bf G}A)B = R_{B}^{T}(R_{A}^{T}{\bf G}) = (R_{A}R_{B})^{T}{\bf G}
   = {\bf G}(AB) \quad,
\]
</p>
<p> where \( AB \) denotes a product of symmetry operations, defined such that \( (AB)({\bf r}) = A(B({\bf r})) \) for any \( {\bf r} \).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="user_basis_star_sec"></a>
Wavevector Stars</h1>
<p >The first step in the algorithm used by PSCF to construct symmetry adapted basis functions is to partition the set of all of the distinct reciprocal lattice vectors used in the Fourier expansion of periodic functions on a lattice into non-intersecting subsets of wavevectors that are related to one another by symmetry group operation. As already noted, we refer to each such set of symmetry related wavevectors as a star.</p>
<p >Two simple examples may help illustrate the idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a 1D crystal with inversion symmetry (a centrosymmetric lamellar phase), any two nonzero, inequivalent wavevectors \( {\bf G} \) and \( -{\bf G} \) are related by inversion symmetry and thus form a star containing these two wavevectors.</li>
<li>In a 3D cubic crystal, all of the wavevectors with Miller indices that are related to a particular set of non-negative integers \( \{hkl\} \) by changes in sign of one or more indices and/or permutations are related by symmetry elements of a cubic crystal. The number of wavevectors in such a star is always equal to or less than 48 if the integers i, j, and k are all nonzero and unequal, and is less than 48 if any of the integers h, k, and l are equal to zero or if any pair of these integers are equal.</li>
</ul>
<p >Wavevectors in a star are always related by point group operations associated with elements of the space group, as described above, and are always vectors of equal magnitude. More formal definitions are given below.</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_basis_star_defn"></a><b> Definition (Star) </b>: A <em>star</em> star \( T \) of a space group \( S \) is a set of reciprocal lattice vectors with the following two properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closure under \( S \): For each wavevector \({\bf G} \in T\) and symmetry operation \( A \in S\), \( {\bf G}A \in T \).</li>
<li>Connectivity: For each pair of wavevectors \( {\bf G} \) and \( {\bf G}&#39; \) in \( T \), there exists a symmetry operation \( A \in S \) such that \( {\bf G}&#39; = {\bf G} A \).</li>
</ul>
<p >Comment: If two wavevectors \( {\bf G} \) and \( {\bf G}&#39;\) are related by any sequence of symmetry operations in \( S \), then \( {\bf G} \) and \( {\bf G}&#39; \) are also related by a single symmetry operation in \( S \) that is given by the product of the operations in that sequence. The requirement that any two wavevectors in a star be related by a single symmetry operation is thus completely equivalent to a requirement that they be related by some sequence of symmetry operations.</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_basis_star_intersect_thrm"></a><b> Theorem 4 (Intersecting Stars are Equal) </b>: If \( T \) and \( T&#39; \) are both star functions of a space group \( S \) with \( T \cap T&#39; \neq \emptyset \), then \( T = T&#39; \).</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: Suppose that \( T \cap T&#39; \neq 0 \). Suppose that \( {\bf G} \) and \( {\bf G}&#39;\) are wavevectors such that \( {\bf G} \in T \cap T&#39; \) and \( {\bf G}&#39; \in T&#39; \). Because both \( {\bf G} \) and \( {\bf G}&#39; \) are in \( T&#39; \), there must exist \( A \in S \) such that \( {\bf G}&#39; = {\bf G}A \). Because \( T \) is closed under multiplication by elements of \( S \), this implies that \( {\bf G}&#39; \in T \), or that every vector in \( T&#39; \) is also in \( T \), or \( T&#39; \subseteq T \). By reversing the roles of \( T \) and \( T&#39; \), by assuming that \( {\bf G} \in T \cap T&#39; \) and \( {\bf G}&#39; \in T \), we may also show by analogous arguments that \( T \subseteq T&#39; \), and thus that \( T = T&#39; \).</p>
<p ><a class="el" href="user_basis_page.html#user_basis_star_intersect_thrm">Theorem 4</a> is logically equivalent to the statement that unequal stars must have an empty intersection. It also implies that a star cannot be proper subset of another star.</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_basis_star_generate_thrm"></a><b> Theorem 5 (Generating a Star from a Wavevector) </b>: Suppose that \( {\bf G}_{0} \) is a reciprocal lattice wavevector, and \( S \) is a space group. Let \( Q \) be the set of all wavevectors such that for each \( {\bf G} \in Q \) there exists \( A \in S \) such that \( {\bf G} = {\bf G}_{0}A \). Set \( Q \) is a star of \( S \) that contains \( {\bf G}_{0} \).</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: Because \( S \) must contain the identity element \( E \), and \( {\bf G}_{0} = {\bf G}_{0}E \), \( Q \) must contain \( {\bf G}_{0} \). To prove that \( Q \) is a star, we must prove closure under \( S \) and connectivity, as defined in the above definition of a <a class="el" href="user_basis_page.html#user_basis_star_defn">star</a>.</p>
<p >Proving closure: Suppose \( {\bf G} \) is a wavector in \( Q \) and that \( A \) and \( B \) are elements of \( S \), such that \( {\bf G} = {\bf G}_{0} A \). Let \( {\bf G}&#39; = {\bf G}B  = {\bf G}_{0}(AB) \). Observe that \( AB \in S \), because \( S \) is closed under multiplication. This implies that \( {\bf G}B \in Q \) for any \( {\bf G} \in Q \) and \( B \in S \), proving that \( Q \) is closed under \( S \).</p>
<p >Proving connectivity: Consider \( {\bf G}, {\bf G} &#39;\in Q\), for which there exist \( A, B \in S \) such that \( {\bf G} = {\bf G}_{0}A \) and \( {\bf G}&#39; = {\bf G}_{0}B \). Observe that \( {\bf G}&#39; = {\bf G}C \) where \( C = A^{-1}B \), and that \( C \in S \).</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_basis_star_unique_thrm"></a><b> Theorem 6 (Every Wavevector Belongs to a Unique Star) </b>: If \( {\bf G} \) is a reciprocal lattice wavevector and \( S \) is a space group, then \( {\bf G} \) belongs to exactly one star of \( S \).</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: Let \( T \) denote the set that is generated by applying all the elements of \( S \) to \( {\bf G} \). By <a class="el" href="user_basis_page.html#user_basis_star_generate_thrm">theorem 2.5</a>, \( T \) is a star of \( S \) that contains \({\bf G} \). Suppose \( T&#39; \) is also a star of \( S \) such that \( {\bf G} \in T&#39; \). This implies \( T \cap T&#39; \neq \emptyset \) and thus, by <a class="el" href="user_basis_page.html#user_basis_star_intersect_thrm">theorem 2.4</a> , that \( T = T&#39; \).</p>

<p >Some properties of star functions follow immediately from the their definitions as superpositions of waves with wavevectors that belong to a star.</p>
<p ><b> Theorem 7 (Star Functions are Eigenfunctions of the Laplacian )</b>: Every star function \( \phi({\bf r}) \) associated with a star \( T \) of a space group \( S \) satisfies an eigenfunction equation  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[

<p> in which the eigenvalue \(\lambda\) is equal to the square magnitude of any of wavevectors in star \( T \).</p>
<p ><em> Proof: </em> Each star function is a superposition of waves with wavevectors that are related by unitary point group operations, and are thus wavevectors of equal magnitude. Because these waves are all thus eigenfunctions of the Laplacian with equal eigenvalues, any superposition of these waves is also an eigenfunction of the Laplacian with the same eigenvalue.</p>
<p ><b> Theorem 8 (Star Functions of Different Stars are Orthogonal ) </b>: If \( \phi({\bf r}) \) and \( \phi&#39;({\bf r}) \) are star functions associated with different stars of the same space group, then they are orthogonal, in the sense that  </p><p class="formulaDsp">

<p ><em> Proof </em>: Orthogonality of star functions follows from the fact that waves with different wavevectors are orthogonal in the same sense, and that the intersection of different stars is an empty set.</p>

<p >The stars of a space group that are cancelled are the same as the ones for which systematic cancellations of scattering intensities are observed in scattering experiments.

<p ><em> Centered Lattices </em>: The simplest reason for cancellation of stars in PSCF occurs in the case of face- or body-centered lattices if one uses a conventional Bravais lattice with orthogonal Bravais basis vectors that yield a non-primitive conventional unit cell (e.g., simple cubic or tetragonal) that contains two or more primitive unit cells. In these cases, the associated space group must contain symmetry operations of the form \((I, {\bf t})\) that simply translate the structure by a fraction of a unit cell along each Bravais lattice direction. For example, a a body-centered-cubic lattice can be described by a simple cubic Bravais lattice and space group that includes a centering operation \((I, {\bf t})\) with \({\bf t} = (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)\). This sort of description, which is used by default by PSCF, leads to cancellation of stars of wavectors that belong to the reciprocal lattice of the lattice with a non-primitive unit cell (e.g., simple cubic) but that actually do not belong to the reciprocal lattice of the centered lattice. <br  />

Uncancelled Stars</h2>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_basis_starfunc_uniqueness_thrm"></a><b> Theorem 13 (Dimension of the System of Phase Relationships) </b>: If \( T \) is a star of space group \( S \) that contains \( M \) wavevectors, and the phase relationships among wavevectors in \( T \) do not contain any unary contradictions, than the star is not cancelled, and phase relationships among wavectors in \( T \) form a homogeneous system of \( M - 1 \) independent linear equations for the coefficients of waves in an associated star function. A full set of independent phase relationships is provided by the phase relatonships between any one wavevector in \( T \) and the other \( M - 1 \) wavevectors in \( T \).</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: The assumption that there are no unary contradictions among the phase relationships between wavevectors in \( T \) implies that there are also no binary contradictions, by Theorem 12. Let \( {\bf G}_{0}, {\bf G}_{1}, \ldots, {\bf G}_{M-1} \) denote the wavevectors in \( T \), listed in some arbitrarily chosen order. Let \( c_{i} \) denote the coefficient of the wave with wavevector \( {\bf G}_{i} \) in the definition of an associated star function. For each \( i = 1, \ldots, M-1 \), there must exist a symmetry operation \( A_{i} = (R_{i}, {\bf t}_{i}) \) such that  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[

</p>
<p> If the number of symmetry operations in \( S \) is greater than \( M \), then there may exist two or more symmetry operations that generate the same wavevector \( {\bf G}_{i} \) when applied to \( {\bf G}_{0} \). If so, we may define \( {\bf A}_{i} \) to be any one of these operations, and the assumption that there are no binary contradictions implies that different choices will lead to equivalent phase relationships. The phase relationships between \( {\bf G}_{0} \) and the other vectors in \( T \) gives a set of \( M - 1 \) independent linear homogeneous equations for the coefficients, each of which is an equation of the form  </p><p class="formulaDsp">
\[

\[
   {\bf G}_{j} = {\bf G}_{i} A^{-1}_{i}A_{j} \quad.

          = c_{0} e^{i{\bf G}_{0}\cdot {\bf t}_{j}}
\]
</p>
<p> that is equivalent to a combination of the phase relationships between \({\bf G}_{0}\) and \({\bf G}_{i}\) and \({\bf G}_{j} \). Expanding the system of \(M-1\) binary phase relationships that involve the coefficient \( c_{0} \) by adding additional phase relationships that do not involve \( c_{0} \) is thus found to leave the dimension or rank of the system of equations unchanged. In a star with no unary or binary contradictions, the set of all phase relationships thus form a system of exactly \( M - 1\) independent homogeneous linear equations for \( M \) coefficients. The resulting system of equations always has a non-empty set of nontrivial solutions, and is thus not cancelled.</p>

Closed Stars</h1>
<p ><b> Definition (Closed Stars) </b>: A set of wavevectors \( T \) is <em>closed</em> under inversion if, for every wavevector \( {\bf G} \in T \), \( -{\bf G} \in T\).</p>
<p >The following theorem simplifies the treatment of closed stars:</p>
<p ><a class="anchor" id="user_basis_closed_real_thrm"></a><b> Theorem 15 (Closed Stars Yield Real Star Functions) </b>: If \( \phi({\bf r}) \) is a star function associated with a star that is closed under inversion, then there exists a complex constant \( c \) for which \( c \phi({\bf r}) \) is a real-valued function of position \( {\bf r} \).</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: Suppose that \( \phi({\bf r}) \) is a nonzero star function associated with a star \( T \), and is thus invariant under the space group \( S \) used to define the star. Let \( \phi({\bf r}) = u({\bf r}) + iv({\bf r}) \) where \( u \) and \( v \) are real functions that represent real and imaginary parts. Observe that \( u \) and \( v \) must also be invariant under \( S \). Consider the cases in which one or the other of these real functions is zero, or in which they are both nonzero. If \( u({\bf r}) \neq 0 \) and \( v({\bf r}) = 0 \), then \( \phi({\bf r}) \) is real, and \( c \) can be any real number. If \( u({\bf r}) = 0 \) and \( v({\bf r}) \neq 0 \), then \( -i\phi({\bf r}) \) is real, and \( c \) can be any pure imaginary number. If \( u({\bf r}) \neq 0 \) and \( v({\bf r}) \neq 0\), then \( u \) and \( v \) are two functions that are superpositions of waves in star \( T \) and symmetric under space group \( S \). Because the set of such functions is a vector space of dimension 1, this implies that there exists a real constant \( d \) such that \( v({\bf r}) = d u({\bf r}) \) for all \( {\bf r} \), giving \( \phi({\bf r}) = (1+id)u({\bf r}) \). In this case \( \phi({\bf r})/(1+id) \) is real, giving \( c \propto 1/(1+id)\).</p>

Open Stars</h1>
<p ><b> Definition (Open Sets of Wavevectors) </b>: A set of wavevectors \( T \) is <em>open</em> under inversion if, for every wavevector \( {\bf G} \in T\), \( -{\bf G} \notin T \).</p>
<p >Note that this definition does <em> not </em> define set of wavevectors to be open under inversion if and only if it is not closed. The above definition is more restrictive: A set \( T \) is open only if, for <em> every </em> wavevector \( {\bf G} \in T\), \( -{\bf G} \notin T\). A set of wavevectors can thus be neither open nor closed if it contains a non-empty subset of wavevectors for which the inverse is also in the set, and another non-empty subset for which the inverse of each wavevector is not in the set. It turns out, however, that this hypothetical intermediate case cannot occur for a star of a space group.</p>
<p ><b> Theorem 16 (Stars Are Either Open or Closed) </b>: Every star of a space group must be either open or closed.</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: First consider the special cases of stars with only one or two wavevectors. If a star \( T \) contains only one wavevector \( {\bf G} \), then \( T \) is closed under inversion if \( {\bf G} = 0 \) and open under inversion if \( {\bf G} \neq 0 \). If a star \( T \) contains exactly two wavevectors, \( T = \{ {\bf G}, {\bf G}&#39; \} \), then both wavevectors must be nonzero vectors of equal magnitude, and \( T \) is closed under inversion of \( {\bf G}&#39; = -{\bf G} \) and open otherwise. Now consider the case of a star that contains three or more nonzero wavevectors. Suppose that a star \( T \) of space group \( S \) contains three or more nonzero wavectors, and that is not open, so that there exists at least one wavevector \( {\bf G} \in T \) for which \( -{\bf G} \in T \). Let \( {\bf G}&#39; \) be any other wavevector in \( T \), for which \( {\bf G}&#39; \neq {\bf G} \) and \( {\bf G}&#39; \neq -{\bf G} \). There must exist a symmetry operation \( A = (R, {\bf t}) \) in \( S \) such that \( {\bf G}&#39; = R^{T}{\bf G} \) . Closure of the star under symmetry operations then implies that \( - {\bf G}&#39; \) is also in \( T \), because \( -{\bf G}&#39; = R_{A}^{T}(-{\bf G}) \). This implies that a star that is not open must be closed, completing the proof.</p>
<p ><b> Definition (Inverse of a Set of Wavevectors) </b>: If \( T = \{ {\bf G}_{1}, \ldots , {\bf G}_{M} \} \) is a set of wavevectors, then \( \{ -{\bf G}_{1}, \ldots , - {\bf G}_{M} \} \) is known as the inverse of \( T \). If a star is open, then it has no intersection with its inverse. If a star is closed, it is equal to its own inverse.</p>
<p ><b> Theorem 17 (The Inverse of an Open Star is a Star) </b>: If \( T \) is an open star of wavevectors for space group \( S \), then the inverse of \( T \) is also a star of \( S \).</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: We first prove closure of the inverse of \( T \) under \( S \): For each vector \( -{\bf G} \) in the inverse of \( T \) and each space group operation \( A = (R, {\bf t}) \) in \( S \), the vector \( (-{\bf G})A = -({\bf G}A) \) is also in the inverse of \( T \), proving closure.</p>
<p >We next prove connectivity: Suppose \( {\bf G} \) and \( {\bf G}&#39; \) are both nonzero wavevectors that belong an open star \( T \) of space group \( S \), for which there must exist a symmetry operation \( A = ( R, {\bf t}) \) in \( S \) such that \( {\bf G}&#39; = R^{T}{\bf G} \). This also implies that \( -{\bf G}&#39; = -{\bf G}A \), thus implying that any two vectors \(-{\bf G}\) and \(-{\bf G}&#39;\) in the inverse of \( T \) are related by a space group symmetry.</p>
<p ><b> Theorem 18 (Star Functions for Open Stars) </b>: If \( \phi({\bf r}) \) is a star function of space group \( S \) that is associated with an open star \( T \), then the complex conjugate \( \phi^{*}({\bf r}) \) is a star function associated with the inverse of \( T \).</p>
<p ><em> Proof </em>: Suppose that \( T = \{ {\bf G}_{0}, \ldots, {\bf G}_{M-1} \} \) is a non-cancelled open star of space group \( S \) that contains \( M \) wavevector. Suppose that \( \phi({\bf r}) \) is an associated star function, given by a superposition  </p><p class="formulaDsp">

<p >By <a class="el" href="user_basis_page.html#user_basis_closed_real_thrm">Theorem 9</a>, this implies that, a real star function can be defined for every star of any centro-symmetric group,</p>

<p ><em>Proof</em>: If the group has an inversion center at the origin, it has an symmetry operation \( i = (-I,0) \) that relates an vector \({\bf G}\) to \(-{\bf G} = {\bf G}i\). The associated phase relationship requires that the coefficients of the two associated waves must be equal. By Theorem 19, it is always possible to define a real star function associated with every star of such a group, in which coefficients of waves with wavevectors \({\bf G}\) and \(-{\bf G}\) must be complex conjugates.

<p >Comment: The conclusion that coefficients of all waves can be chosen to be real for star functions of such groups does not mean that the the coefficients of different waves within a star are necessarily all of the same sign. In a group that has an inversion center at the origin but that also contains contain glide plane or screw axes symmetries, it possible for phase relationships arising from these other symmetry operations to require coefficients of different waves within the same star to be of opposite sign.
