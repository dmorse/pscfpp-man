</p>
<p>Almost every subdirectory of the src directory tree contains a makefile (except the src/tests directory), and there are also makefiles in the root and namespace-level directories of the bld directory tree. Each of these makefiles contains a rule for a default target named "all" that constructs all of the targets for which that makefile has responsibility.</p>
<p>Many PSCF makefiles share a similar structure, but there are differences in the contents and structure of makefiles located at different levels of the PSCF directory tree. Different types of makefiles are found in the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Low level subdirectories of src</b> : These are makefiles that are located within subdirectories of one of the namespace-level directory trees within the src directory. The "all" target of each such makefile creates a set of object target files by compiling all of the source files that are located in the tree rooted at the directory containing the makefile (i.e., in that directory and any enclosed subdirectories).</li>
<li><b>Namespace-level (not program-level) subdirectories of src or bld</b>: The "all" target of makefiles in the util, pscf, and prdc namespace-level directories of either src or bld each creates a static library file, in addition to creating a set of object files by compiling all the source files in that namespace-level directory tree.</li>
<li><b>Program-level subdirectories of src or bld (not program level)</b>: The "all" target of makefiles in the r1d, rpc, and rpg program-level directories of either src or bld directory each creates a single executable file (pscf_1d, pscf_pc, or pscf_pg), in addition to making a static library and compiling all of the source files in the associated directory tree.</li>
<li><b>src and bld directories</b> : The "all" target of a makefile located in the root of either the src or bld directory tree compiles the entire PSCF package to produce several executable files.</li>
<li><b>PSCF root directory</b> : The "all" target of the master makefile in the PSCF root directory performs an out-of-source build of the entire package.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these types is discussed below, starting with makefiles in the lowest level of the directory tree, and working our way up.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_makefile_srcsub_sec"></a>
Makefiles in lower level subdirectories of src</h1>
<p>The simplest PSCF makefiles are those that that are located in subdirectories of one of the namespace-level directories within the src directory tree. As an example, the contents of the makefile in the directory src/rpc/fields is shown below:</p>
<pre class="fragment">#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Include *.mk makefile fragments

include ../../config.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/patterns.mk

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Main targets 

all: $(rpc_field_OBJS) 

clean:
   rm -f $(rpc_field_OBJS) $(rpc_field_OBJS:.o=.d) 

#--------------------------------------------------------------------
# Include dependency files

-include $(rpc_field_OBJS:.o=.d)
</pre><p>This makefile has three main sections that are separated by horizontal lines and labelled by comments. Makefile lines that start with # character are comments, which are ignored by the make command parser.</p>
<p><b> Including *.mk makefile fragments: </b>:</p>
<p>The first section of this file contains three "include" directives that include makefile fragments that are needed in the rest of the file.</p>
<p>The directive "../../config.mk" includes the src/config.mk configuration file in the src directory. The path for this file is given here using a relative path in which the symbol ".." refers to a parent directory. The path "../.." thus refers to the parent of the parent of the current working directory. In this example, the make command would use this makefile only if were invoked from the directory $(ROOT_DIR)/src/rpc/field that contains this makefile. The path "../.." is thus the relative path to the PSCF src directory from the current directory in which make was invoked.</p>
<p>A relative path must be used to include the relevant config.mk file in every PSCF makefile because the makefile variables SRC_BLD that provides absolute paths to the src directory and the build directory are defined in config.mk file. These variables thus cannot be used until after this file is included. Note that later include directives for the required sources.mk and patterns.mk files can and do use values of these variables to specify the locations of these files.</p>
<p>The directive "#include \$(SRC_DIR)/rpc/sources.mk" includes the sources.mk file in the src/rpc/field directory. This file includes the definition of the variable src_field_OBJS that is used in the rest of this makefile. This variable is assigned a value in the file src/rpc/field/sources.mk, which is then included by src/rpc/sources.mk</p>
<p>The directive "#include \$(SRC_DIR)/rpc/patterns.mk" includes the src/rpc/patterns.mk file that contains the relevant pattern rule for compiling *.cpp and *.cu files with the src/rpc directory tree.</p>
<p><b> The "all" target: </b>:</p>
<p>The makefile rule for the "all" target is given by the line </p><pre class="fragment">all: $(rpc_field_OBJS) 
</pre><p> The variable value $(rpc_field_OBJS) expands to a list of absolute paths to all of the object file targets associated with source files in the subdirectory src/rpc/field that contains this makefile.</p>
<p>By listing all of these object file targets as pre-requisites, the rule for the "all" target forces make to check on the status of all of these object files, and update any of them that do not exist or are out-of-date. A pattern rule for defining *.cpp sources files that is defined in the file src/rpc/patterns.mk is used to create or recreate each required object file pre-requisite, as needed.</p>
<p><b> Including dependency files </b>:</p>
<p>In order to check whether particular object files are out-of-date, make needs access to the dependency file associated with that object file. The last part of this example file includes dependency files associated with all of the object file targets in the src/rpc/field directory. This is accomplished by the directive </p><pre class="fragment">-include $(rpc_field_OBJS:.o=.d)
</pre><p> The purpose of this directive to include all existing *.d dependency files that are associated with object files located in the src/rpc/field directory. The variable value $(rpc_field_OBJS:o=.d) is obtained by using a built-in substitution operator to the list rpc_field_OBJS of absolute paths for all object file targets in the src/rpc/field directory, and replacing the .o suffix of each file name by a .d suffix. The resulting value is thus a list of all of the associated *.d dependency files. This include directive instructs the system to attempt to include all of the files in this list. The dash ("-") that appears before the "include" keyword is a special symbol that instructs the make command to quietly ignore failures that may occur if one or more of the more dependency files in this list do not exist.</p>
<p>Each dependency files is created as a side effect of a pattern rule that also creates an object file target. As a result, the dependency file associated with an object file does not exist before the first time that the object file is created. When a file that is the target of a rule does not exist, however, the target is always considered out-of-date. As a result, a non-existent object file target will thus always be built as needed, either if the rule to construct the target is invoked, or if that file is needed as a pre-requisite for some other target. The list of prerequisistes of an object file target is thus only needed after the file is first created, to determine whether an <em>existing</em> object file is out-of-date.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_makefile_namespace_sec"></a>
Makefiles in namespace-level directories (not program-level)</h1>
<p>As already discussed, the src/ and bld/ directories have analogous internal structures, and either can be used as the "build" directory for, respectively, out-of-source or in-source builds. The src and bld directories each contain 6 subdirectories named named util/, pscf/, prdc/ r1d/, rpc/, rpg/ that we refer to as namespace-level directories, because each contains the source code defined in a particular C++ namespace. The 6 namespace-level subdirectories of the bld/ directory contain makefiles that are identical to those in corresponding subdirectories of the src/ directory.</p>
<p>The three namespace-level directories named r1d/, rpc/, and rpg/ are distinguished by the fact that each of these directories contains a source file that defines the main function for an executable program. We refer to these three directories as program-level directories. Makefiles in the program-level directories are different from the other namespace-level directories because they define additional rules to compile this main program file and link it to create an executable. In the remainder of this section, we consider the makefiles in the three namespace-level directories named util/, pscf/ and prdc/ that are not** also program-level directories.</p>
<p>The main difference between the makefiles in the util/, pscf/ and prdc/ directories and those found in lower level subdirectories of the src directory is that the all target in these namespace-level makefiles makes a static library file. The rule to create the static library file is defined in sources.mk file in each of these namespace level directories, rather than in the corresponding makefile.</p>
<p>As an example, the body of the makefile in the src/prdc directory is shown below. The makefile variable value $(prdc_LIB) is defined in the included file $(SRC_DIR)/prdc/sources.mk file, and gives the path $(BLD_DIR)/prdc/libprdc.a to the static library file target in the prdc namespace-level directory of the build directory.</p>
<pre class="fragment">#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Include *.mk makefile fragments

include ../config.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/prdc/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/prdc/patterns.mk

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Main targets 
 
all: $(prdc_OBJS) $(prdc_LIB) 

clean:
   rm -f $(prdc_OBJS) $(prdc_OBJS:.o=.d)
   rm -f $(prdc_LIB)
   rm -f *.o */*.o */*/*.o
   rm -f *.d */*.d */*/*.d
   cd tests; $(MAKE) clean

very-clean:
   $(MAKE) clean

.PHONY: all clean veryclean

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Include dependency files

-include $(prdc_OBJS:.o=.d)
</pre><p>The key difference between the structure of this file and that of the makefiles in lower-level subdirectories of src is that, in this case, the rule for the "all" target contains the path $(PRDC_LIB) to a static library file target as an extra pre-requisite, in addition to the variable $(prdc_OBJS) that lists all of the associated object files. Because make updates all pre-requisites of phony rules, this forces the makefile to build both the object files and the library file.</p>
<p>The use of a relative path ../config.mk in the directive that includes the configuration file allows make to include the bld/config.mk when make is invoked from a namespace-level subdirectory of bld directory but to include src/config.mk when make is invoked from a namespace-level subdirectory of the src directory. The makefiles in namespace-level subdirectories of src and bld are thus identical, but they included different configuration files when make is invoked from within different directory trees.</p>
<p>The explicit inclusion $(prdc_OBJS) in the prerequisite list for the "all" target is actually redundant, but does no harm. The rule to build the library $(prdc_LIB) that is defined in the file src/prdc/sources.mk gives the list of object file targets $(prdc_OBJS) as a prerequisite. Any attempt to build this library file would thus trigger creation or recreation of any out-of-date object files in the list $(prdc_OBJS), as needed, even they were not listed explicitly as a prerequisite of the "all" target. A more concise version of the phony "all" rule could thus list the library file as its only prerequisite. The list of object file targets is included for clarity, to explicitly document the normal sequence of operations triggered by this target.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_makefile_program_sec"></a>
Makefiles in program-level directories</h1>
<p>We now consider makefiles located in the r1d, rpc, and rpg program-level subdirectories of the src or bld directories. These makefiles each define two additional rules that do not exist in makefiles located in the util, pscf, or prdc namespace-level directories. The first additional rule gives instructions to create an object file by compiling a file that contains a main function for a complete program. The second additional rule gives instructions to create an executable file by linking this main program object file to several library files. Because the executable file is created by a rule that links library files that are located in other namespace-level directories, the makefile in each of these program-level directories must include source list (sources.mk) and dependency files (*.d) files from these other namespace-level directories, as well as those from the program-level directory that contains the makefile.</p>
<p>As an example, here is the body of the makefile in rpc program-level directory: </p><pre class="fragment">#------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Include *.mk makefile fragments

include ../config.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/util/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/pscf/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/prdc/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/sources.mk
include $(SRC_DIR)/rpc/patterns.mk

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Paths to pscf_pc program files

# Base path to *.o and *.d files for pscf_pc
PSCF_PC=$(BLD_DIR)/rpc/pscf_pc

# Path to pscf_pc executable file
PSCF_PC_EXE=$(BIN_DIR)/pscf_pc

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Main targets 

all: $(rpc_OBJS) $(rpc_LIB) $(PSCF_PC_EXE)

clean:
   rm -f $(rpc_OBJS) $(rpc_OBJS:.o=.d)
   rm -f $(rpc_LIB)
   rm -f $(PSCF_PC).o $(PSCF_PC).d
   rm -f *.o */*.o */*/*.o
   rm -f *.d */*.d */*/*.d
   cd tests; $(MAKE) clean

# Rule for pscf_pc executable file
$(PSCF_PC_EXE): $(PSCF_PC).o $(PSCF_LIBS)
   $(CXX) $(LDFLAGS) -o $(PSCF_PC_EXE) $(PSCF_PC).o $(LIBS)

# Short phony target for executable file (for convenience)
pscf_pc:
   $(MAKE) $(PSCF_PC_EXE)

.PHONY: all clean pscf_pc

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Include dependency files

-include $(util_OBJS:.o=.d)
-include $(pscf_OBJS:.o=.d)
-include $(prdc_OBJS:.o=.d)
-include $(rpc_OBJS:.o=.d)
-include $(PSCF_PC).d 
</pre><p>Note the following elements of this file that are not present in the makefiles in the util, pscf, and prdc namespace-level directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Definition of a variable PSCF_PC = $(BLD_DIR)/rpc/pscf_pc that gives the shared part of the paths for the object and dependency file that are created by compiling the program source file <a class="el" href="pscf__pc_8cpp_source.html">src/rpc/pscf_pc.cpp</a>, without the .o and .d file name extensions.</li>
<li>Definition of a variable PSCF_PC_EXE = $(BIN_DIR)/pscf_pc that gives the absolute path to the resulting executable file.</li>
<li>A rule to build the executable file $(PSCF_PC_EXE) by linking the main program object file $(PSCF_PC).o to all relevant library files.</li>
<li>The "all" target lists the main program executable $(PSCF_PC_EXE) as a prerequisite.</li>
<li>Include directives to source.mk files and dependency files that are located in the util, pscf, and prdc namespace-level directories, as well as those located in the rpc directory that contains this makefile.</li>
<li>An include directive to include the dependency file $(PSCF_PC).d associated with the main program source file, which contains a rule for the corresponding object file target that lists its prerequisites.</li>
</ul>
<p>Inclusion of sources.mk and dependency files from other namespace level directories is necessary in this case to allow the make command to check whether the libraries located in other directories are up to date before linking them to create an executable, and to build or rebuild any that are found to be out-of-date. The rules to build the static library in each relevant namespace-level directory is defined in the sources.mk file in that directory, which is then included by this makefile.</p>
<p>Inclusion of source list and dependency files from other namespace-level directories is <b>not</b> necessary in the makefiles located in the util, pscf, and prdc directories because these makefiles do not define a rule that links static libraries from different namespace-level directories to create an executable.</p>
<p>The type of rule used here to create an executable main program file is very similar to the pattern rule that is used create <a class="el" href="developer_build_pattern_page.html#developer_build_pattern_test_sub">executable files for unit tests</a> . The pattern rule for unit test executables in a particular namespace-level directory is defined in the corresponding <a class="el" href="developer_build_pattern_page.html">patterns.mk</a> file. The rules for main program executables and unit test executables both create an executable file by using a compiler to link an object file to a list of libraries represented by a variable $(LIBS) that is defined in the patterns.mk file.</p>
<p>In this example, the object file $(PSCF_PC).o is created by compiling the main program file h$(SRC_DIR)/rpc/pscf_pc.cpp. This object file will be created before the executable file because the object file is list as a prerequisite of the executable. This main program object file is created as needed using a standard pattern rule for compiling source files, which also creates a corresponding dependency file $(PSCF_PC).d as a side effect. <br  />
</p>
<p>The main program object file is not included in the list of files that are archived to create an associated static library. For example, in the rpc namespace-level directory, the file $(PSCF_PC).o is not included in the list $(rpc_OBJS) of object files that are collected into the library file $(BLD_DIR)/rpc/librpc.a .</p>
<p>Explicit inclusion $(rpc_OBJS) and $(rpc_LIB) as prerequisites of the "all" target is redundant, but these are included to help document the sequence of actions triggered by the "all" target. Any required building or re-building of these object and library file targets would in any case be triggered by a request to build the executable target $(PSCF_PC_EXE), because the rule for $(PSCF_PC_EXE) lists $(rpc_LIB) as a pre-requisite, and the rule for $(prc_LIB) lists the files in the list $(prc_OBJS) as prerequisites. A more concise version of this rule could thus list the the executable file target as the only required prerequisite of "all".</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_makefile_upper_sec"></a>
Makefiles in src and bld directories</h1>
<p>The makefiles in src and bld directories, which are identical, each contain an "all" target that operates by recursively invoking make from within namespace-level directories. Below, we show the essential parts of these makefiles that are necessary to see how the "all" target is implemented: </p><pre class="fragment">include config.mk

# ======================================================================
# Main build targets

# Build all CPU and GPU programs
all:
   $(MAKE) all-cpu
ifdef PSCF_CUDA
   cd rpg; $(MAKE) all
endif

# Build all programs that uses exclusively CPU hardware
all-cpu: 
   cd util; $(MAKE) all
   cd pscf; $(MAKE) all
   cd r1d; $(MAKE) all
   cd prdc; $(MAKE) all
   cd rpc; $(MAKE) all

   .
   .
   .

# ======================================================================
</pre><p>Here $(MAKE) is the value of a standard variable that represents the name of the unix make command. The two target shown here both contain recipes that instruct the system to repeatedly descend into a namespace level directories. The "all-cpu" target is designed to build only the two programs that use standard CPU hardware, pscf_1d and pscf_pc. The "all" target is designed to also create the pscf_pg executable if compilation of CUDA code has been enabled by defining the PSCF_CUDA makefile variable.</p>
<p>The phony "all-cpu" target simply invokes make all within 5 of the 6 namespace-level subdirectories, including the two program-level subdirectories r1d and rpc that build the CPU programs pscf_1d and pscf_pc, but excluding subdirectory rpg that contains CUDA C++ code for pscf_pg.</p>
<p>The "all" target first invokes cpu-all and then conditionally invokes "make all" from within the rpg subdirectory if and only if the makefile variable PSCF_CUDA is defined. The variable PSCF_CUDA is undefined by default, and is defined if and only if the user has explicitly enabled compilation of CUDA code. The "all" target thus compiles code in the rpg directory and creates the pscf_pg executable only if CUDA compilation has been enabled. Compilation of CUDA code can be enabled either by using the setopts script, using the -c option with argument 1, or by manually uncommenting the definition of the variable PSCF_CUDA in the relevant config.mk configuration file.</p>
<p>The "all" target is the first target in the identical makefiles located in the src and bld directory, and is the default target. Invoking "make" with no target from either of these directories is thus equivalent to invoking "make all" from the same location.</p>
<p>The remainder of this makefile defines a number of other targets that enable the user to compile only part of the package, to run unit tests, and to clean up after compilation. The purposes of these other targets are explained by comments in the makefile, and are also generally rather self-explanatory.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="developer_build_makefile_root_sec"></a>
Makefile in the PSCF root directory</h1>
<p>The rule for the "all" target in the makefile located in the PSCF root directory is given by: </p><pre class="fragment">all:
   cd bld ; $(MAKE)
</pre><p> Invoking this rule from the root directory is thus equivalent to invoking "make all" from within the bld directory. The effect in either case is to perform an out-of-source build of the entire package.</p>
<p>A variety of other targets are defined in the makefile in the root directory, but not discussed here. Purposes of these other targets are explained by comments in this makefile. The recipes for most targets in this makefile are simply wrappers that recursively invoke make from within the bld, bld and src or docs directory, like the recipe for the "all" target. Rather than repeating brief descriptions that are given in the makefile, we recommend that users take a look at this makefile.</p>
